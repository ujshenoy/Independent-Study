Which would you pick and why?My ortho allows his patients who start out with braces to switch to Invisalign later on if they\\'d like, for no additional fee. I currently have ceramic braces and need to decide soon if I want to switch to Invisalign. \\n\\nI am in my late twenties so would definitely appreciate Invisalign being harder to notice than braces but not sure about the discipline portion of Invisalign and not being able to eat whenever I want. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think? What would you choose?\\n\\nETA: very interesting to see most people are recommending braces even tho this is an Invisalign sub!Continuing your ceramic braces will probably mean you finish treatment earlier? Which is more important to you - time vs appearance of the braces?considering this is an invisalign sub, literally everyone would tell you to go invisalign routeI agree the answers may be biased. But I have also seen others post on this sub that they regret Invisalign or vent their frustrations about Invisalign\\n\\nETA: most people are actually recommending braces even tho this is an Invisalign sub!It\\'s usually people in their first week. There\\'s an adjustment period at first, then it gets easier.I had invisalign and absolutely loved it but tbh if you already have the ceramic braces I\\'d just finish with that.I\\'ve had braces and Invisalign.\\n\\nI think braces do a better job. My smile was immaculate after braces. Invisalign has gotten close, but any bite issues have been much harder to solve, and that\\'s really what I wanted to fix.\\n\\nAlso, while braces are sometimes more of a nuisance (wires cutting into you and whatnot), the knowledge that it\\'s just ALWAYS working is so useful. With invisalign, if you accidentally leave them out too long, you can set your whole treatment off even if the aligners are tracking. For instance, one of my front teeth moved a little too far behind the other one set of trays, and it has never moved back. I am on refinements (tray 5 of 14) but I don\\'t see how it\\'s going to move forward without them adding more space for the tooth to move.\\n\\nIf I\\'d been able to swing braces again, I would have.Thanks for sharing your perspective. What prevented you from doing braces again?I was told that Invisalign was just as effective these days, so I went with the more flexible option.\\n\\nAfter having gone through it, I don\\'t really agree with what I was told.Id choose braces. Ive had them before (currently in Invisalign) and for me they worked faster, and got my teeth closer to perfection in my eyes.\\n\\nIm crazy about wear time in my Invisalign and they just dont look that impressively straight like my braces had them looking years ago. Im on my last 3 trays.I work for a dentist. We were recently working on a patient who was upset that her teeth werent perfect after Invisalign refinements.\\n\\nAfter she left, he turned to me and said, œWhat does she expect? Its Invisalign.\\x9d\\n\\nIf you want perfection, stick with the ceramic braces.Thank you for this! I think so many expect the perfection braces give you with Invisalign but for so many, it doesnt work like that - youre never going to get true perfection with it unless youre teeth are already pretty great (at least, this is what Ive seen).whichever is faster honestly.I had ceramic braces for about 6 months then had them taken off. I\\'m now about 4-5 months into invisalign. I had one tooth wayyyyy out of alignment my ortho said invisalign wouldn\\'t be able to fix. \\n\\nGiven the choice I would pick invisalign every time. Personally I found braces so much more painful. There were quite a few foods I couldn\\'t eat at all the entire time. I couldn\\'t really bite anything with my front teeth. With invisalign there is only some minor discomfort for maybe up to 5 days at the beginning of a tray. I can eat absolutely anything I want without concern. Sure there are still a few things I would stay away from but with braces I had to cut up a sub into bite size pieces. \\n\\nObviously other people have different experiences thoughThanks for sharing your perspective! What was the total time you were quoted for your treatment? Did switching to Invisalign add time to your treatment?I\\'m sure it added some time just because of waiting for trays to come in and whatnot. I think I was told 18 months for braces. Or roughly the same for braces then invisalign. If I don\\'t need refinements that should be about right. 6 months for braces and it\\'ll be 13 months on invisalignThere are 3 reasons I didn\\'t even consider braces over Invisalign:\\n\\n\\\\-appearance\\n\\n\\\\-had braces when i was a kid and found them SO painful. i was unable to eat after each appointment, had terrible canker sores etc \\n\\n\\\\-i like being able to remove the aligners for an important meeting or even just to eatYes. This has always been my argument as well. Braces suck. Thankful for them, but they suck lol.Ceramic! Coffee, tea and food :)I drink coffee through a straw all day with Invisalign, non issue for me.They would become permanently stained so quickly if you drink a lot of coffee/tea.I have never had braces, but I would go with them if I had that option from my Ortho. I just started my first set of Invisalign refinements after an initial 47 week plan. (47 more trays.) I\\'m very unhappy with the process and have been saddled with a ridiculous open bite for months. I have at least one attachment on every tooth so ceramic braces would have been a little faster and I really doubt much worse.I don\\'t get this. Were you not going for check ups during the 47 weeks to see what was going on? Were you not shown a clincheck plan to see what you\\'d look like at the end?\\n\\n\\nThis sounds like a bad ortho more than anything else. Refinements should literally just be for when you get to the end and something isn\\'t *quite* right, not that everything is totally wrong.In their defense they told me to expect 2 years total and then started me out on 47 weeks, so I think they planned the refinements to be intensive. I was shown a clincheck but it absolutely did not have only 2 teeth touching.\\nWhen I started Invisalign I had one crooked lower tooth and an overbite that I wasn\\'t even aware of.\\n\\nAs for check ups, they planned exactly 1 check up around halfway and acted like I was a huge pain in their ass when I set up two more appointments for problems along the way (eg too many attachments coming off). I absolutely feel like they\\'ve been a bad Ortho as well, but they\\'re a diamond+ provider with excellent reviews so I thought I\\'d done a decent job of researching.Sorry to hear you\\'re not happy with your process. What exactly are refinements and why do you have to do 47 more trays when you just finished 47 initial trays?Refinements are exactly what they sound like! First round of trays is usually between 20-50 on average and then the Ortho assesses the teeth to see if they need refining. You then get a set of new trays to wear for however many you may need. Though from what I see on this sub, 47 for refinements is a lot Like another commenter said, the refinements are a rescan when you get done with your trays to see if you need more/what still needs to be fixed.\\n\\nI was told at the start of treatment to expect 2 years total since overbite is hard to fix, so it\\'s not that I didn\\'t expect to get that many trays the second time. What I didn\\'t expect was to nearly be unable to chew for months because there is a gap between all my molars so large I can pass a pencil through them. \\n\\nFor reference, my starting point was one crowded/crooked lower tooth and I wasn\\'t even aware of the overbite until they told me.I definitely wouldnt say they are less visible than braces. You may end up with a ton of attachments like I did: see [here](https://imgur.com/a/VcXvLdo)I did not end up with as many attachments as you have, but even in your case it is significantly less visible. People generally dont see teeth in my experience. Like at all. Vast majority were honestly surprised i finally spoke up about it. I can spot invisalign from miles away, rest of the people dont even pay attention. Its pretty cool.\\n\\nWith ceramic braces everyone always know. Its the metallic wire and ceramic which is not quite like the tone of teeth, that pop out immediately.Exactly, the only people who notice my attachments are people who have also had Invisalign.No. Nearly everyone I see regularly asked if I switched to braces when I got my attachments put on. I had strangers ask what kind of braces I had because they looked different. They were definitely noticeable.Invisalign has been a breeze for me so far but if youre already into your treatment with braces I dont see the point in changing, just ride it outIt\\'s 2022, you should smile in 32 with ceramic braces - it is literally \"look guys I can spend 10 grands on my smile\" swag. If your only worry is looks - just finish braces.I wanted Invisalign myself as Im 34f and obviously older than what is considered usual for braces. But both my dentist and orthodontist said it wouldnt be worth wearing them as they would fully correct my bite, and therefore my teeth wouldnt be perfectly straight either - I want as perfect a smile as I can get.\\n\\nThe Invisalign would also take up to three years to do the job that clear braces will do in 18 months - and the Invisalign wont even fully do the job! I also know I dont have the discipline for Invisalign, at least the braces will do the hard work for me without too much from me bar the meticulous cleaning on my side.\\n\\nBut, as others have said, it all depends what matters most to you, time or appearance - I wanted the quickest, fastest way to straight teeth and braces were it. Though so many have braces now, at any age, that I really wouldnt worry about it - when I see them, I think its shows the person really cares about their appearance in the best way. Also dont forget that if you dont wear the Invisalign as much as you should, youll end up needing to wear them for even longer. My orthodontist said its common for patients in her practice to initially get Invisalign but switch braces after a year as they find it too time consuming with all the trays! \\n\\nPersonally, I think its down to how much work you need done on your teeth - a few trays I could do but over 40 and up and Id lose the will! I also think quite a few orthodontists/dentists are too quick to go the Invisalign route when its braces that are really needed - you dont get the same perfection with Invisalign IMO unless your teeth were super straight to start - and I know a few that had Invisalign and were disappointed the teeth werent as perfect as they had hoped. For some, the braces are needed for the heavy lifting.Id stick with braces, particularly If youre in a position to attend the monthly adjustment appointments. The reason I went with invisalign was due to being able to go longer stints of time without needing to physically go to the dentist office.Invisalign is nice because its less visible (duh) and you can take them out to eat. But its still a pain in the ass. Ive never had traditional braces, but I think I would prefer InvisalignI currently have both and I think they both have cons. I do struggle to eat and chew more with the ceramic(top) than I do the Invisalign(bottom). My top teeth feel much weirder when I eat and it drives me nuts. Especially after they change the wire for about 3 or 4 weeks.Woah I had no idea you can do both! What\\'s that process been like and why did you decide to do both instead of braces on both top and bottom or Invisalign on both?Well my top bite is mainly the problem and the Ortho was concerned my canines wouldnt turn easily with the Invisalign. He said they can be the most stubborn. so I have 6 brackets on top front teeth and Invisalign on the bottom. Once the canines move to his satisfaction ( he said 6 months but theyve been moving well so far so Im hoping its less) I will switch to trays on top too. It was interesting adjusting to different kinds of braces as an adult.Having been on Invisalign more than a year now and doing more research (watching lots of case study videos on YouTube) I would go with braces if I didnt have a teeth grinding problem (being able to sleep with a guard is necessary for my teeth). \\n\\nI dont really have pain with Invisalign and do enjoy picking up intermittent fasting as a result of the treatment but there are some cons. Maybe grass is greener on the other side so who knows. \\n\\nCons:\\n1) ortho dont tell you about the wait between scans so that can add at least 2-3 months depend on how many scans youll need\\n2) your teeth can be very stubborn (no one can predict how much) and that can extend your treatment for an unknown amount of time. I was quoted 9-12 months but its looking more like 16 now maybe more \\n3) Ortho only see you every 8 weeks on average and if things didnt work (teeth not tracking, bite not moving etc.) you basically wasted 8 weeks \\n4) Braces seem to be able to handle more complicated cases better and faster than Invisalign.My ortho told me Invisalign was quicker. He gave me a rough estimation of 7-9 months on Invisalign and 12-15 months with braces.My ortho told me Invisalign was quicker. He gave me a rough estimation of 7-9 months on Invisalign and 12-15 months with braces.So back in December 2021 I was supposed to get ceramic braces on top and metal braces on bottom teeth (am 23). My orthodontist decided that he would put me on aligners because it would be near impossible to achieve alignment without extractions and with braces. More precisely, I would probably have quite protruding teeth, because braces can\\'t move the backmost teeth bacwards, and aligners can. So now I am doing aligners with no extractions, and I paid for ceramic braces only because he made the choice for me basically. I have 67 trays and 67 weeks (am on 18 now), but he said that after those 67 weeks my treatment will most likely have to be finished with braces, but that we\\'ll see how it goes. \\n\\nThe thing is I\\'d chosen ceramic because they\\'re really quite subtle as far as braces go and are much cheaper. I could have paid for aligners but I didn\\'t want to bother with having to constantly take them out. And I still ended up with them (at a much lower price). \\n\\nYes, it\\'s annoying sometimes that you have to take them out if you want tou put anything besides water in your mouth, but ultimately I am glad I have them. Besides some very mild discomfort once in a while, they have so far been completely painless, and they are virtually invisible. People are always so surprised when I point them out. The process has been rather slow, but I have to trust in it.I ate and drank with aligners in as prescribed actually as my treatment was done at an invisalign rapid clinic! It was great and I\\'d do it again.I chose Invisalign for the cost. It was 1k cheaper. At the time of consultation I was on an incredibly tight budget. However, I had to get orthodontic work to bring down an impacted canine. I went on my journey in my very late 20s early 30s. \\n\\nI also opted for Invisalign because there were less trips to the Ortho. This was right before the pandemic and it was difficult to schedule visits frequently for tightening. \\n\\nOnce the pandemic hit, it was easier for me to get there, as I lived half an hour away, and working from home would have made it significantly easier to get there. I worked an hour and a half away from the orthodontist office at the time. \\n\\nIf I were to make the choice again, I would likely choose braces. I\\'m happy with my result, however I would always forget to put my trays back in after eating. This ended up extending my treatment because my canine wouldn\\'t track.My ortho offered regular braces and Invisalign at the same price, ceramic for $450 more. I was partial to ceramic, but I liked the concept of being able to eat sticky foods without popping a bracket off or having to floss around them. I wasnt sure if I could remember to put them back in after eating, and sometimes I do forget, but so far so good. Braces are reliant on your ortho. He does all the work, you just show up. Invisalign is more the opposite. You have to do the work, as in wear them, and the ortho just checks in every once in a while. So its going to lie where you are comfortable in accountability.Stick with the braces. Braces will allow you to finish sooner as compared to switching to Invisalign. Its much better at moving stubborn teeth and will give you slightly better resultsThe main reason I choose Invisalign is that I can see the clincheck before start. With braces youll have to have more faith in the doctorWhats clincheck?Its a 3D model of the teeth that shows the movement of each tray and final resultIf I had to start all over, I think Id go the braces route. While I like the ability of being able to take them out to clean my teeth, I do find myself obsessing over the wear time and I realize Id probably do better with an option that I couldnt take out.Im not sure but Im planning to get fixed braces next. Ive had invisilign for 18 months but it has failed to move a couple of teeth that needed height adjustment.I\\'m towards the end of my invisalign treatment + refinements and it looks like perfect symmetry of the front teeth (canine to canine) is just not going to happen. They look very good, so much better than before, but they will probably not get perfect even if the ortho gives me another round of refinements.\\n\\nIf I could do it again with this knowledge I\\'d probably do ceramic braces instead.', 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'facial appearance', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'tray time management', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'oral hygiene', 'financial concerns'], 'scores': [0.2595674991607666, 0.13902278244495392, 0.13812722265720367, 0.13757213950157166, 0.13472408056259155, 0.10318774729967117, 0.08779854327440262]}, {'sequence': 'How long do you leave your braces off to eat?I know they say to keep them on for at least 22 hours but Im sure my lunch and dinner are about an hour each by the time I eat and have my hot drink • And thats not including breakfast.

I know everyone gets different advice in this area, but my own provider even told me using it 5 minutes 3 times per day has shown to help with tracking.\\n\\nThe first few seconds helps seat the trays which is crucial, but chewing them for a few minutes after that stimulates the tooth movement too.

I get anywhere from 16-20 hours on a given day. Change trays every 7 days and Im tracking perfectly. Again though it depends on youre teeth. I have some room to play with so my teeth arent being pushed back so it depends on everyone!Mostly agree but the faster the tray changes, the more diligent you need to be about 22 hours.

I take my time and get like 20-21 hours inEven the Invis website says 20-22. Dont let it stress you out.I often eat my breakfast with my aligners in (usually some fruit and a rice cake). Some doctors say not to but Ive seen a lot of people whose doctors say this is ok with softer foods so long as you rinse your mouth with a good amount of water. This has saved me the extra 30 minutes or so and allows me to have them off for my 45 minute lunch and dinner. \\n\\nBut as everyone above has mentioned, 22 is the recommendation because they know people will still play with fire as far as time goes and 20-21 hours is totally fine as long as you use your chewies !Thanks!

Probably 5-6 meals a day.  If its something not too sticky, ill have a piece of gum then put my aligners back in.  If leaves a lot of residue in my mouth, ill wait 15-20 minutes, then have a brush.  Probably leads to the aligners being out of my mouth for about 3 to 3.5 hrs per day.Take your time! Invisalign ruined mealtimes for me - I *had* to eat fast.

Im really terrible at remembering to put them back on after eating. Should I switch to braces or will I still see changes just slower?Your trays will stop tracking or youll have to wear each one way longer. You could also experience root damage and loose/lost teeth. Be honest with your ortho/dentist so they can adjust the treatment plan to you or switch you to braces if needed. Dental health isnt something to play with. You can do some serious damage if youre not following instructions.Thank you for the reminder that this is why I need to wear my trays all the damn time. \\n\\nLots of moving pieces in life lately and so Id been neglecting wearing them as much as I had previously. Its like I just forgot that I dropped several 1000s on these bad boys and that I want the end result!Keep persevering. I had to set an alarm before taking mine out to remember to put them back in. Now I cant stand to have them out and my teeth feel nakedSame here. Ive been sick this past week and have forgotten to put them back in for longer stretches. Its amazing how one day can wreck weeks of a formed habit.Do you know why this would cause root damage?When teeth move the roots also move. If this is done too quickly and the roots dont have enough time to settle in one position then the length of the roots shorten and can eventually lead to real damage, including tooth loss. Google root resorption.Constantly switching between wearing the trays and a large amount of time without the trays holding your teeth in place means you are basically wiggling the tooth loose. Your jaw bone has no time to rebuild and hold things securely in place. Think of how you would remove a stake from the ground...My guess is if they dont achieve the movement they are supposed to due to lack of compliance but still move on to the next tray causing extreme pressure on the roots. Movement has to happen gradually to avoid damage. An ortho also talk about causing damage by œjiggling\\x9d teeth. If their lack of compliance is causing their teeth to move while trays are on but also move back due to the length of time not wearing them, that can cause long term issues. \\n(If Im wrong on any of this and someone knows for sure, Id love to learn)Probably depends on the persons teeth, but getting loose to move then not being held in place is probably bad. Not a dentist.Discuss this with your orthodontist and see what they suggest. My orthodontist did offer me the option of wearing my trays 12 hours a day and changing them every two weeks. \\n\\nOrset yourself an alarm. Or use one of the apps that remind you to put your trays back in. I used to forget sometimes in the beginning but it soon became a habit. If theres something you want to remember or make a habit there is always some sort of app to help! Id say its worth it finding a way to wear your trays a lot more.Have you got the Tray Minder app? It reminds you to put your trays back in after eating and you can track how much time you\\'re wearing them. Its really good, and free.What if you forget about the Tray Minder app \\x81I would hope for the sake of OPs future patients they are not this forgetful (theyre in med school)Actually the fact Im in med school 80% of the time and cant have my phone on me, let alone too busy to be attentive to it makes it hard to keep up with the app. Health professionals are human too you know?Were just making a joke. But if you want to be serious then be serious about using the app and remembering when to insert them backI started getting like this midway through treatment and my teeth stopped tracking. Had to get rescanned. Luckily Im on comprehensive so no extra charge, but now Im on tray 8/46 and have a long way to go. I wear my trays religiously now. If your teeth are still tracking properly, definitely try to wear them at least 20 hours a day, and if you really cant commit to this, then it might be a good idea to switch to braces.œHey Siri, set a timer for 30 minutes.\\x9dI dont understand how you can forget to wear them when you or someone else paid 5-7k for them.Honestly if you have ADHD (like me) I can see how this happens. I use TrayMinders timer so I get an alert 45 min after I take the aligners off. Remember you should be wearing them *all* the time unless youre eating.I have pretty bad depression and while its good right now, my meds make me really spacey. I dont mean to forget things but it happens. Trust, this is a ficial strain for me and even with that burden hanging over me, I still forget.

Its a vicious cycle. TrayMinder app didnt helpI feel you. ADHD and grad school plus 3 kids and a job. Ive started intermittent fasting and eating one meal a day so that I have no reason to take them out. Its worked really well for making it feel strange to not have them in.I think you could definitely talk to your ortho and see another option (i.e., traditional braces) would be better for you considering your lifestyle. My ortho did not recommend regular braces for me because of the slowest pace we were aiming for due to my case being somewhat complex with gum issues. But if switching is an option, perhaps that would yield better treatment adherence and thereby results within the projected timeline.\\n\\nI think Invisalign providers should really focus on providing something like a lifestyle comparability for Invisalign. For example, my partner was really keen on getting Invisalign for himself but Ive pretty much scared him of the prospect. Basically...he saw how it wouldnt work his lifestyle. Hes an All Day espresso drinker and a snacker, and the fact that he has been diagnosed with ADHD since his childhood, he knew he wasnt able to keep up with the extra layers of dental hygiene that was critical.Set an alarm on your phone and don\\'t turn it off. Only allow yourself to hit the 1 minute snooze button. \\n\\nHow often are you taking them out? Maybe you can reduce the number of times you eat and have to put them back in. Don\\'t brush until after you eat in the morning. Take them out right before breakfast, then brush and put the trays in right away.Nah dont switch. Just adjust. Take em out and leave in front, try to set a timer when theyre out to remind yourself. Ive went through different mental phases where i will take em out at lunch and go till 8pm when im home without putting them in again. Itll be fine. Just work towards being better.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd people saying \"how could you possibly forget, you paid $Xk for them!!\", go play in sand.It seems like you have at least identified the problem. There is a lot of discipline involved with Invisalign because its patient led so no one else can do it for you. \\n\\nI think you should start keeping them in front l you in a bowl of water while eating, so once youre done eating you know you need to clean and them put them back in. \\n\\nIve managed 22-23 hours a day and I started a month ago. You have to make eating a planned event and time it. You are in med school so you are clearly a smart individual who can figure out how to make it work. Dont just be okay with it working slower for you, make it work right.As someone with adhd, Im choosing the braces route because I would constantly lose or forget to put my trays back in. Braces just do the work 24/7 without having to remember tray changes or putting them back in after every meal. Id make the switch if I were you!Ok in the beginning I was religiously wearing mine for about 20-22 hours a day. A year later, I am probably down to about 14 hours a day max and my teeth are tracking perfectly! In my experience, depends how far into your treatment you are.Im on Tray 11/65. My first 5 Trays I was doing great 20-22hrs a day. After that I started getting less and less on track with my aligners. I tried the TrayMinder app. Worked 2 days before I would just forget about it. My problem is Im a snacker and runner (running with them on gives me dry mouth) so I take them out often. During clinical, I take them out to eat or sometimes because I have a terrible lisps and my senior patients cant hear me, so I give in and take them out to enunciate better. When I take them out, I do sometimes remember I need to put them back in BUT i hate putting them in without brushing my teeth & aligners. It grosses me out. So I tell myself ok, Ill go get it done in 5-10 mins or after this tasks and then just get busy/side tracked and forget. This month has been my worst because of final exams and just a super busy month. \\n\\nOn Tray 8, I mentioned to my ortho my concerns. Told him, I was wearing them (at that time) 16-18hrs a day. He said it was too early in the treatment to see how well theyre tracking and to just continue shooting for the 20-22hrs. He told me to switch to 7days vs 5 days before switching. I have about 4mm gaps from extractions were trying to close.I found running with them really challenging early on but eventually the dry mouth goes away - I just completed a half marathon with them in and the route drink stations had clear Powerade so that was nice! \\n\\nI also work in hospital and see medical students daily in my facility - I do think you might have challenges with what the demands are on your time for food, snacks - Its brutal to brush teeth or carry things around in clinical that isnt what you need to do your job. I have an office and keep a toothbrush at work but even I dont want to clean my teeth in the hospital bathrooms and there are so few that arent shared with the public etc. I cant see you going to the staff change rooms every time to brush either. There isnt time.\\n\\nI really struggled with the running and work life eating balance for a few months - maybe work on getting them back in after snacking with or without brushing and see how that goes. \\n\\nI know loads of people have busy lives and make this work but Ive seen clinical staff cry in my office over the past two years - is been a busy and chaotic time - and students of all kinds find it hard onsite at the best of times - there are a lot of demands and cognitive load. Invisalign might not be a great fit for right now but could be later. I just wanted to empathize because its not always about the money or intent or laziness for why its not working for you. \\n\\nGood luck!!!Really good to hear about your experience! I am only on my 2nd tray. I\\'m a runner, but since getting Invisalign I haven\\'t done longer than 5 miles. I do a lot of half marathons so I\\'m happy to hear it\\'s possible!Eat with them on and clean them after. Or try intermittent fasting. If youre a med student, you should practice not getting a lunch break in preparation for your future career ‚I find it curious not to remember to put back the trays after washing the teeth. This way wearing so little you are certainly getting no effect whatsoever. So don\\'t take the trays out for eating, eat with trays on. Seriously! That way you will remember to put them back after washing your teeth since they are already there.I keep my trays out for longer than I should and I have not had any issues. However my Ortho always had me on every two week switches so I think it doesn\\'t matter as much for me as it does for someone doing weekly changes.Think about your day as a pendulum, 12 hrs on and 12 hrs off would net you a ZERO change. So at 14 hrs of wear, you want as many hours between 12 and 24 hrs....anything less than 12 and you\\'re literally not even going to move them. It\\'s also bad for the tissues that hold your teeth into the roots....Basically at 14 hrs you\\'re...barely moving forward. \\n\\n\\nWear your damn trays as expected, or switch to braces. The other thing to consider is that in order to keep the results, you\\'ll need to wear a retainer at night for the rest of your life. If you don\\'t, your teeth will go back to where they are in a few years. Effectively voiding the work you\\'re doing now.\\n\\nWhat do you think is the issue with wearing them? Can you make a system to wear them that you can stick to? I was netting 22-23 hrs a day as i eat only once a day and would just remove to brush.You already have Invisalign. No point in switching now tbhGet the Invisalign app. It reminds you when to put your aligners back on after eating. Its helped me a lot!I know everybody is different but I do struggle to understand how people dont wear them for the allocated times if theyre not in your mouth except for when you are eating where are they?? You need the tray minder app, you need to get into a routine, you need to set a timer on your phone just so youre not wasting time and money the only person this is going to affect is yourself.When I thought it was too inconvenient to put them back in (e.g if I was out with my friends and wanted to eat/drink more than once throughout the day),\\nI would just wear my trays for a few days longer than I was recommended to. I wore a tray for 9 days once when I\\'m meant to change weekly, and I didn\\'t have any issues, besides obviously prolonging my treatment time (I didn\\'t really mind because I\\'m not in a rush to finish).This is just my own opinion, but I notice that people here who have issues following throw with the Invisalign are either too young or don\\'t have any skin in the game (aka, someone else is paying for the Invisalign )\\n\\nI pay 4k for this shit, there is no way in hell I\\'m not getting the value back just for being lazy. \\n\\nDon\\'t mean to come out like a D, but you should be graceful that someone else pays for it and actually follow through with the process.I pay for it. havent had my parents or anyone help me with anything since my early teens. So you can take your assumptions elsewhere.you should be glad not to know what its like to live with ADHDeurodivergenceYep! Paying for mine 100% myself and my meds make a space shot.So much this.

You already paid for your Invisalign and I doubt you can get a refund for this custom treatment. \\n\\n1. Have more self awareness.\\n2. Meanwhile you can start to set a timer for ex 30 mins every time you eat as a reminder to put them back in. In due time it should become a habit.\\n\\n3.

I have always wanted to straighten out my teeth. \\n\\nI know the first tray or two might be difficult to get used to, but I have some other questions.\\n\\nWhen searching the subreddit, I find that most adults getting Invisalign have had braces when they were younger/in highschool. Is there anyone that did invisalign as an adult who never had braces/invisalign could share their story/tips/tricks?\\n\\nAnother question I had is about teeth removal. My ortho said that there is a chance I may have to get 1-4 teeth removed in order for everything to sit/fit well. Is there anyone who, as an adult, experienced this and could you tell me a little more about that experience?\\n\\nThank you! :DIm 26F on tray 8/37 and never had braces before! I would say my teeth are quite bad too - deep overbite that will never actually resolve fully and crooked teeth. \\n\\nHonestly I think Ive been really lucky, apart from the lisp and pain in the first week Ive not really felt that its been a hassle. My biggest issue is when Im eating outside of my home but my dentist told me to just use mouthwash, rinse and brush properly when Im back home. \\n\\nTips- carry mini/travel mouthwash everywhere and get some dental wax ahead of your first trays. Download the Invisalign app so you can track how long youve had your aligners out for and save your 1st trays if possible to look back in awe! If you dont already, get an electric toothbrush (according to my dentist) its less harmful when brushing your teeth after meals that a normal brush (hope someone here can corroborate this though) \\n\\nOn teeth removal- I think it might be worth getting another consultation with a different ortho. Removing teeth as an adult isnt really recommended so most Invisalign users get IPR (teeth shaving) instead. I have heard that theres circumstances where it might be necessary and especially if the Invisalign is necessary and not just cosmetic.dental wax? don\\'t know if I\\'vbe heard of that before, I\\'ll check it out! Also I didn\\'t know invisalign had an app so i will definitely get that. also thank you for the idea of getting a second opinion, I think because of your reply and the other replies I will definitely get another opinion. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nthank you for your reply :)I\\'m 38 and I have to get two upper premolars removed because I have moderate crowding and a class 2 bite.

The first three days I was regretting it so much. Hurt and felt really just uncomfortable. My only tip is to stick it out, they feel normal ish now. Also go on Amazon or wherever and buy an orthokey, it helps so much! And I also bought a cute pouch to keep the orthokey, toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, mouthwash, case for trays and Tylenol.Thank you for the tip!

I will tell you, today I am pretty sore, but its bearable. I have attachments on all of my teeth except for 3, and the soreness is primarily on the insides of my mouth due to the attachments rubbing. I have a few hefty attachments that are the culprits. I am trusting my ortho and folks here who have said after time, your attachments feel less sharp and your mouth adjusts. Tylenol has helped. Optimism has been key for morale! I do have a lisp as well, but its steadily improving. I couldnt stop laughing at myself all day yesterday any time I tried to talk. I recommend singing in the car and in the shower to help with that!\\n\\nI was also told I needed premolar extraction to truly fix my bite (class 3 underbite & a crossbite). In my case, the other option was double jaw surgery. I thought initially I was going to do the premolar extraction/camouflage route but ultimately am pursuing double jaw surgery (I have a surgeon for that working in tandem with my ortho). So I will do 40 trays, surgery, and then when healed enough do another 40 or so trays. \\xa0\\n\\nI ordered some extra ortho keys, toothbrushes, xylitol mints, chewies, mouthwash, floss etc and have little kits at home, at work, in my Jeep anywhere I routinely am just in case I forget the kit I also have in my bag. \\n\\nYoure not alone on this journey! Youve got this! Congratulations on this investment in yourself.\\n\\n**edit: I did just have all 4 wisdom teeth extracted 2 weeks ago. So I have some experience with dealing with extractions as an adult. It was uncomfy for sure, but I had no pain or anything after 1 week post-op.Thanks for the reply! I hope the jaw surgery goes well for you and also congratulations to you for your investment in yourself as well! It is nice to know that there are others on this journey, and all these replies definitely have me even more excited to start this journey :D28M here. Started Invisalign in April 2020 and finished in December 2021. Never had braces before. Got all four wisdom teeth removed prior to starting. I still floss and brush after each meal. It\\'s a good habit that I\\'ve built up, thanks to Invisalign.I would not get the teeth removed.   Both due to my personal experience, and [to the testimonies at the end of this article.](https://karinbadt.medium.com/premolar-extractions-for-orthodontic-treatment-2190344bc7bf)Thank you so much. I was worried about getting teeth removed but I was willing to put all my trust in my ortho. Now, I think I\\'ll be getting a few more opinions from other orthos before I make any solid plans.Please do know that I would recommend more than a few---depending on where you live.\\n\\nFor example, if you are in New York City, odds are that one in four orthodontists will not recommend extractions.  In Germany, almost all orthodontists will not recommend extractions.  If you are in South East Asia, less than one in 100 will  not recommend extractions.  Small town southern USA:  probably the odds of South East Asia.\\n\\nWhen you choose the second opinions, I would make sure one of them is an \"airway-focussed\" orthodontist or puts the word \"health-oriented\" on their website.\\n\\n\"Airway focussed\" orthodontics is a branch that developed about twenty years ago, after it was discovered that extraction/retraction reduces the pharyngeal airway (a fact hotly contested by orthodontists, but proven in 8 research studies).      Airway-focussed orthodontists are more likely to avoid extractions unless absolutely necessary.   But they are not the only ones---just need to find them with a careful search, to hear the alternative plans.\\n\\nOff the record (highly off the record), I happen to know that the airway being negatively affected by retraction  has  so alarmed the dental field (inhouse)  that Columbia University will be  inaugurating the first ever Airway and Dentistry educational program for new dentists.\\n\\nSo the next generation will be ensured more knowledgeable practictioners and safer othodontics.  It is the wave of the future.\\n\\nFor now: one must search.\\n\\nAnd if one is in South East Asia, one must search hard.I am in Canada, so I am expecting it may be something similar to what you said about New York (but I could be wrong lol). I haven\\'t heard about the airway focused orthodontics, but I will be looking into it! \\n\\nI only had an initial consultation with my orthodontist, so i will go there to get full records done and explain my aversion to extractions. If they insist, I\\'ll have those records sent to a few other orthodontists and go from there. \\n\\nWhat I\\'ve done so far is looked at the Invisalign website to see where to find orthodontists, and I am specifically looking into going to a bigger city to find one.\\n\\nI also didn\\'t think of it before, but I am also going to check out if there are any TMJ/TMD orthodontist\\'s, maybe that would also be helpful, if it\\'s a thing. \\n\\nThank you again for the advice! There more I think about it, getting teeth removed seems like a pretty bad idea for me so looking into other options is very helpful.I have a few \"health\" conscious ortho names from Canada  that were recommended by patients, so I can send to you if you wish. (Know that I do not know them), but at least a lead.I would appreciate that! Any leads will be helpful, and if any of the names that I have already seen pop up within those names, then I know to give them a shot! :)please send me your photos/xrays to my whatsapp number...easier for me to flash up my phone and show colleagues inbetween conference meetings.    I am leaving the conference tonight or tomorrow morning so hope to get them before I leave...darn, I may not have them by then as I am getting my full records done this upcoming thursday (they didnt take a photo of the initial scan done during my consultation)37 year old who never had braces! Im on tray 13 of 19- pretty jacked bottom teeth and one pushed back front top tooth Ive always hated. Other posters  cover all the main points-  I still have problems lisping slightly with some trays which bugs me but overall its not too terrible. Try not to clench- Ive had to really focus on not doing that! Also you might find yourself getting discouraged around 10 trays in- not much noticeable difference for all the effort- but all of a sudden- I have a new smile and Im so mesmerized by it. Good luck and congrats on finally doing this for yourself!I keep saying this to people on this sub, but it is so helpful to read experiences from people who are over half way or even finished with their treatment! I keep feeling like there isnt any progression (tray 4 now), but reading that more people feel this way at the beginning, and hearing this is normal, helps me so so much. Thank you!It one day just will feel like overnight things have changed still have some progress to go but its so so rewarding once you see it! Im hoping its soon for you :)Thank you so much for the congratulations, I\\'m really happy about doing this! And luckily I have been practicing not clenching for the past year or so, so i have a mini head start on that haha :) \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nps- congrats to you as well for doing this for yourself :DI am a 39F I started my Invisalign treatment in December 2021. I am now on tray 17/40. I wasn\\'t fortunate enough to have braces of any kind as a child. I have found that once you get in a good routine with wearing/cleaning them ext. you will be just fine. I really only struggled with Tray 1. Wax was my bestfriend and I did have to shave down a few sharp trays in the beginning, but overall.. I\\'m a happy camper!!! I carry a small makeup bag with me ag all times. floss, toothpaste, toothbrush.I did not know about the wax before, I\\'ll check it out!I (27F) started my Invisalign treatment last month and Ive never had braces before. Its been good! \\n\\n-The first few trays are particularly painful, but it helps if you switch trays before you go to bed so the initial pain is while you sleep. If youre going to use pain meds to mitigate that, use acetaminophen (Tylenol) not ibuprofen (Advil). Ibuprofen reduces inflammation, but that inflammation is needed to help your teeth move. \\n\\n-Get yourself a foldable travel toothbrush and dental floss to keep in your purse/bag, and swish your mouth and brush both your teeth AND your trays each time you put them back in. If youre in a rush, chewing sugar free gum real quick can help clean out your teeth before putting the trays back in. Get a waterpik if you can, it really helps keep between your teeth and gum line clean. \\n\\n-If youre particularly forgetful, then make sure you download the Invisalign app and the TrayMinder app so you can keep track of how long you have your trays out. Always put your trays in the case, and always put the case in your purse. This makes it easier to not lose them or accidentally break them. If you still forget, it can be helpful to put the case somewhere obvious but inconvenient, like in your bra or front of your pants lol\\n\\n-Use dental wax if the edges of your trays are hurting your tongue” roll out the wax into a long skinny snake and press it onto the edge. If its not sticking well, make sure your hands are warm when youre rolling it out, your tray is warm and dry when you apply it, and the lil wax snake you rolled out is thick enough. Try not to squish it on the inside very much” when you put the tray on it will smear wax on the inside of the tray and make it hard to get out. If you do get wax in there, scrub your trays with hot water and dish soap, being sure to get into the attachment bumps. \\n\\n-The only thing acceptable to have in your mouth when your trays are in is water. Everything else runs the risk of staining your trays and teeth, or getting stuck in your trays and causing cavities. \\n\\n-Its normal for the trays to have a little bit of a gap when you first switch them” your teeth need time to move to their new positions. If at the end of your tray you still have gapping, dont switch your tray, keep it in for 2-3 more days. If the gapping doesnt go away, call your doc/ortho. If the back of your tray feels like its really loose and wont grip your tooth, you can very gently pinch the edges towards each other, and that should help it grip your tooth and stay on. \\n\\n-You may have attachments fall off. If its just one or two, they probably wont reattach them right away. Keep an eye on those teeth” if they start not tracking properly and your trays arent fitting on those teeth specifically, then make an appointment to have them reattached. \\n\\n-If you have crowded teeth and you dont see changes in your smile in the first few months, dont fret. Because your smile is crowded, theres not enough room for your front teeth to be corrected. In order for that to happen, first the molars need to be moved to make space, and then the front teeth will be moved after. \\n\\n-I havent had any extractions, but its pretty straight forward. Usually its done for people who have fairly small mouths, and there isnt enough room to space out teeth. Just like any tooth removal, theyll freeze your mouth, then remove the tooth. Then your teeth can move into that space! If youre hesitant and unsure if you want to, you may be able to ask your dentist/ortho if they can show you the projected results with extractions and without extractions so you can decide if its worth it to youthis is awesome, thank you for the comprehensive reply! I will definitely look into the projected results with and without extractions and the app will definitely be helpful.Hi! 26F here. Never had braces as a kid and got Invisalign almost a year and a half ago. Also had 4 extractions done before I got them on!

The biggest issue is my bite - when I bite down goes slightly more to the right.Agree that that no one can really comment on your specific case except the Orthos that you saw.\\n\\nGenerally accepted that traditional braces are better for treating bites. Also the ortho has more control during the treatment since they can make adjustments as needed versus needing to order and wait several weeks for new trays.

Also you have the added benefit of flexibility on eating/drinking whenever and whatever you want.My bite actually went to the right because of a crossbite post-braces. I'm also not super concerned about straight teeth because mine are mostly straight. My orthodontist recommended regular braces because it would be faster and easier, but after spending childhood with a cut up mouth, in terrible pain, and at constant appointments I went with Invisalign because I was still a candidate. I currently have three elastics, I think later on I'll get one more. **For me** they're a bigger hassle with Invisalign than they were with braces, but they're still doable.\\n\\nI would get a third opinion and use it as a tiebreaker.If #2s only concern is that you need elastics, that can be done with Invisalign as well as traditional braces.Just to say, I wouldn't factor in the time period estimated for Invisalign as most people have refinements that can (at least) double the initial plan time.I have elastics now and Im on invisalign. So #2 is either misinformed or is old school and doesnt want to change their ways that have always worked.I might've misunderstood him but he definelty did mention something about elastics. He is very highly regarded when it comes to damon braces so perhaps he is more comfortable with this system.\\n\\nAs my bite is my main issue I want to ensure Invisalign will fix this issue. Orthodontist 1 will email me my Invisalign threatment plan in a few days so I guess I'll be able to tell from that if my bite will actually be corrected.Yeah, I needed surgery to fix my bite issue.

Good luck :)Either, but it really depends strongly on how good ur dentist/orthodontist isYeah I mean Invisalign is good but it is limited in what it can do in comparison to braces. Theres also the possibility that youll start on Invisalign and then end up in braces anyway. Youve got a lot of crowding going on so Id probably expect a bit of IPR. Youll also need some contouring post treatment because youve got strangely shaped front teeth theyve got like dips in the middle so the longer edges will be filed down. It might be quicker and less irritating to go with a ceramic brace.Oh yes I forgot to mention, my front right tooth is a crown filling which ive now had in for 17 years  would that affect getting Invisalign do you know? Thanks for feedback!i have 2 crowns and the one in the front is more stubborn to move but idk if that\\'s cause its a crown.I have 2 crowns and got one during my treatment. No issues.If you ask here youll hear Invisalign, if you ask on the braces sub youll hear braces. Definitely go for that ortho consult and see what they say. In my experience braces are often more recommended for severe bite issues, or if you think youll have any difficulty with the maintece of Invisalign. Either Invisalign or braces should be an option either way, but may have different estimated treatment time depending on your individual case.Sorry newbie to reddit and first time posting!\\n\\nI\\'ve been told by someone who has had Invisalign that my teeth would better suit braces as Invisalign is more for smaller corrections.

Invis gives u flexibility to not look like a 13 years old. \\nI am on a 2 year invis journey with deep over bite, crowding, IPR, tooth extraction and many more problems. My ortho knows what she is doing and I am very comfortable at work cuz No One notices I have InvisOh that\\'s inspiring thank you! Good luck on your journey :)Im 40-ish, and I have similar issues. My ortho said I was a good candidate for invisalign, and Im on my first tray. Only your ortho or dentist will know, but I think that you may be able to get the clear retainers. Do be prepared for an attachment on almost every tooth, though. Invisalign is still fairly noticeable when you are close to someone, especially with all the attachments, but it is more comfortable and less noticeable than braces.While I\\'m not an expert, what I\\'ve gathered reading here is that with Invisalign, it\\'s not about the amount of work to be done, it\\'s about the type of work to be done.\\n\\nThere are some tricky movements that require braces. But if you\\'ve got a mouth that appears to need a lot of work to be done, but it turns out none of that work is complex enough to warrant braces, then Invisalign will probably work fine.Im the same but you can get clear braces! Honestly Invisalign are a lot of work as well and they can take much longer - if I was to go with them even though they wouldnt fully correct my teeth (as per my previous comment, I dont seem the point), itd take 30 months over 18 with braces. Im 34 and asked for the quickest most effective way to give me a Julia Roberts smile - her teeth are amazing!! - and was told braces so going with that.I have a lot of work to do and although my teeth are a bit straighter than yours, I have a top front tooth (lat incisor) that\\'s completely behind the other front teeth. My ortho is always so amazed with my progress and always says that he wouldn\\'t have been able to achieve this kind of movement with traditional braces. Aside from that tooth I have some crowding and I will finish my treatment with no extractions necessary. And I was supposed to get ceramic braces! I was convinced my case wasn\\'t fit for aligners, but the technology is so advanced now that they can basically fix anything. You can check my posts history for a pic of my teeth for reference.It may depend on whether you have bite issues or not. Although invisalign can correct bite issues as well. \\nIf youre able to do invisalign, maybe look into some cosmetic bonding before you do your scans. I went to my dentist for some routine fillings before I began my treatment and he went rogue and did some bonding that caused me to be rescanned lol. He didnt charge me though and to be honest the bonding really helped. They told me it should shorten my treatment time. So we shall seeNAD/ Braces! Go with something traditional and well studied. I used Invisalign and ended up with a fracture in my front tooth, a fracture in a crowned molar ( now needs an implant for $11K) and another smaller fractured tooth (not visible). They work differently. Invisalign tilts the teeth rather than moving them (that\\'s a very high level description). Question the ficial motives of the provider before you make your decision and do more research!I have the same crowding as you and an open bite and my ortho recommended Invisalign. I also have a crown and he said no problem we just left off an attachment.My bottom teeth are quite like yours and I have just started Invisalign. Im having to have an extraction to make space and will also have to have IPR. He did mention the possibility that if it didnt track that they might swap the bottom over to fixed braces but will see how it goes.Check out my page, especially [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/t30rzj/6_weeks_left_unless_my_ortho_changes_his_mind/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\nMy ortho pushed for traditional clear braces but said I -could- do Invisalign if I really didnt want braces. Here I am 19 months later. Im so happy with my decision. Im getting some bonding done on the front teeth but thats still a month away. Good luck to you! Oh wow our teeth are similar. \\nIm in #4 and seeing improvements already.Good luck to you! I saw improvements early too, especially with my bite. It goes by so fast and is 100% worth it.Thanks! I need bonding afterwards. Im 38 and my teeth have been my biggest self criticism. Now I can finally afford to fix them.Im 45, started when I was 43, tons of issues. And its working out very well for me and Im glad to not have a metal mouth. You can do it! Ill end with over 100 trays easily.Either.I always thought that I was not eligible for Invisalign but my ortho said Invisalign was better fr me than traditional braces.  Talk to a good ortho. You may be surprised...Th only limitation that Invis has is if you can afford the treatment :)You can absolutely go with Invisalign. I have three trays left Ive been in them eight months and I cannot believe the difference in my teeth.It really depends on your orthodontist and what they recommend. My teeth are straighter than yours but I still got told no to Invisalign because they wouldnt fully correct my bite - both my dentist and orthodontist said the same. I hate that I cant get the Invisalign but I figure whats the point if they dont fix everything?All treament modalities are technique sensitive meaning it will come down to a good doctor, diagnosis and treament plane.  Guy linked in this  thread is a perfect example.  Also why if one ortho says it cant be done you go to another.Front teeth are much easier to move so even severe cases can be treated with Invisalign. But ultimately, we arent orthodontists and can only see some of your teeth. If your molars have issues or if youve got a malocclusion, you may need braces.\\n\\nFwiw though, I have a crossbite on my very back teeth which is almost impossible to move with Invisalign. Some regular dentists who offer Invisalign told me Id need braces to fix my teeth. When I went to a very experienced, highly credentialed orthodontist, he suggested that we do braces and Invisalign combined. Brackets on my back two teeth for a while until my bite is fixed (thankfully not very noticeable), then Invisalign for my front teeth. That might be an option for you too even if your molars need a lot of work.Braces are easierMaybe schedule some consults and see what they say!If you have the choice. I would choose Invisalign.

Soak up the braces season girl- it'll be over soon and you'll be free and smiling bright!Invisalign definitely isnt painless either.

I think the braces are much easier to notice than the invisalignsAt the end of the day, they're making your teeth straighter, and correcting your bite. If people can see that, whoop dee doo. It doesn't make a difference to anyone at all. And once you start getting elastics placed over the wires with fixed braces, the wires will be barely noticeable until you eat staining foods such as curry (which Invisalign also doesn't like) but you get those changed every 6 weeks anyway.No of course it doesnt matter what anyone else thinks but the person having them probably has an opinion and therefore a preference as to what theyd like. For example, I have a very front facing person centred role and for me, it was important to have something that wasnt visible.Either will hurt the first weeks and then after tray or wire switches. Just stay with it for a few months and you will probably get used to it. If not you can discuss switching with your orthodontist.It is too early to tell what you really think about braces.

OmgdJust curious for those that say Invisalign is more of a hassle than traditional braces, why? (I am currently undergoing Carriere before invisalign).Youre accountable to taking your Invisalign trays in and out and monitoring your wear time, among other things. Braces are just.there. You dont take them in and out so theres less user input on that element of treatment. Some people also lose their Invisalign trays if they dont keep track of them, which is something that cant happen for braces. \\n\\nI dont think the responsibility difference is too terrible, but there is a bit more user responsibility with Invisalign overall.Second that. My previous orthodontist pressured me to do the carriere then Invisalign. Hated it. I was very self-conscious of the carriere motion since it seemed so foreign and unusual, and I also hated the retainer because taking it out to eat was annoying. Dumped him and went to a new orthodontist, and got traditional braces. Much happier now. I'm 19 and got my braces when I was 18.I personally found Invisaligns painless and I had some serious rotation to doInvisalign is not a pain free treatment. Its moving your teeth, there will be some discomfort.You are pretty!

Invisalign Lite includes up to two rounds of refinements, and my ortho is certain that at least one refinement will be necessary. Moving teeth around and changing the bite will always take some timeOh okay. I see. A year isnt so bad though. Is that year including the refinements?Yes, thats right. About 5-6 months for the initial round of 14 trays, and then refinements for about the same time, which results in about one year altogether. If by then things are not as I want them to be and a second round of refinements is in order, I expect about 1.5 years total, but that should really do itOhhh. I see. Thank you! Its helpful to hear from someone with a similar issue.Im not sure how big your overbite is. Fixing mine with some mild crowding, is going to take at east 63 trays (initial plan) and 15 months. Refinements will come on top of that. I have Invisalign Comprehensive.Honestly I dont feel its THAT big of a deal since Ive never had the side effects associated with overbites (no jaw pain, tooth decay, gum disease etc) but Id like to get my crowded teeth fixed so I might as well try to fix the bite while at it haha. Sounds like people have varied experiences.I never had any either, but figured in for a penny in for a pound if I was gonna start Invisalign anyway. The cost would have been the same if I just fixed the crowding, so I thought I might as well fix my bite properly as well! It prolonged the treatment time with at least six months though. Hope you get the results you want ŒThis doesn\\'t necessarily answer your question, but I had a more severe overbite and crowding, and my total treatment time (including refinements) was 14 months.Just looked at your pics on your profile.

Most universities offer it for a fraction of the price because its their final year students who offer these services in order to learn. Its highly supervised by professors and orthodontics so I would trust themIf youre in the US and you have fair-good credit, you can fice the treatment w Care Credit or Alphaeon. Invis would probably be more expensive than braces depending in your area, so try to get a quote for both.The ortho offices have monthly payment plans with 0% interest. Go to some free consults and discuss.Some more than others, but most I've talked to have 0 interest in house payment plans. Your treatment takes time, so they allow you to space out the payments since you will need to be taking the time anyway. The one I'm going with is very flexible.My ortho put a treatment together that would have been $6500 but they had a promotion going on that took off $1000. They also offered me a no intrest payment plan with the initial downpayment of $600 then monthly payments of $180 for my entire 2.4 year treatment.

However, if you have some type of insurance, they can work with you monthly on it. Just do your research and dont be discouraged by this subreddit.Like others have said, I have a 0% interest payment plan with my ortho and I was able to decide myself how much to pay a month for my treatment. It will still be an investment of course but you may be able to afford it after all.Most orthodontists and dental studios here in the Uk have an in house or preferred 0% fice plan - usually they take some sort of deposit upfront to book the treatment and then will have a payment plan that suits you. There is a credit check of course.

She brushes twice a day but usually forgets to floss. We got to the dentist every 6 months to keep on top of things, but she\\'s a teen with ADHD, so take it for what it\\'s worth. \\n\\nMy oldest daughter currently has braces and is able to handle flossing between them and everything that you need to do and my youngest daughter said that she doesn\\'t think she would be able to do that. \\n\\nI\\'m considering invisalign for my younger daughter, but I worry about how hard it is to keep everything clean. I think at best I could probably get her to rinse her mouth after eating and drinking, but I know she probably wouldn\\'t brush after every time. \\n\\nSo if you have had both, which would you say is easier to maintain?Honestly, I think braces might be a better move for her. Because the Invisaligns sit closed on your teeth 22/7, there is none of the regular œwater flow\\x9d you would get from drinking water throughout the day, so plaque/food/whatever is more likely to build up.  For me, Invisalign felt like a full time job. Taking them out to eat every time, rinsing or brushing, flossing in the AM and PM, switching them out every 2 weeks (or however often, I believe everyone differs). \\n\\nI never flossed with my braces as a teen unless there was something suck in them, and only brushed in the am and pm daily. I didnt have any issues with staining and even though I got my treatments about a decade apart, I think regular braces were lower maintece.Everything you say above makes me vote œbraces\\x9d - Invisalign puts a lot of the work of compliance on the patient, and someone so young with ADHD is unlikely to be able to handle that responsibility. If your kid is saying even flossing with braces is too much responsibility, it seems likely that Invisalign will be far too much work. Shed need to be good at keeping track of her aligners, thoroughly cleaning her teeth after meals, ensuring shes getting a good fit, and generally keeping a close eye on her own treatment. Braces is so much more straightforward to do, so Id recommend looking at that when the time is right.Id say braces. If she forgets to floss, she might œforget\\x9d to put the trays in and youre basically supposed to have them in anytime youre not eating or drinking.As former teen with ADHD and removable braces (now with clear aligners) I highly recommend fixed braces. I cannot tell you how many times I lost or accidentally threw out my trays. Its not worth it. Also, after any kind of treatment your daughter will have to wear a retainer. I think most of us that wore braces and are now with Invisalign could not keep up with consistent wear of our retainer, otherwise we would not be repeating treatment. So maybe consider waiting a couple of years until you know she is ready and able to properly commit to it. Its not cheap.Exactly as you say, I had fixed braces from 11-13 ish and my teeth and jaw got messed up again cuz I couldnt keep up with wearing the retainers or stuff like headgear. Basically I was being a lil shit. Fast forward a few years and Ive gotten Invisalign as my last chance of fixing some skeletal and bite issues before I run out of time. However the fixed braces part is pretty much all in the orthodontists control, and I would go as far as saying its more bareable when you are younger. Also from personal experiences I would suggest to get bite issues fixed as early as possible it is a huge stress to deal with some of these issues later due to the littleo amount of growth in the older ages. It is definitely expensive but its almost always more beneficial to start in the earlier ages. Fixed retainers also do exist in case the child can not keep up with the removable ones. The retainer decision can be made towards the end of the fixed braces treatment, which is the treatment that would probably be easier for the daughter and less stressful for the parents in this case(also less expensive)For me was a water flosser a big relief. I would recommend that no matter if you choose invisalign or bracesLove mine so much! LolI also came here to recommend this! My waterpik has been life changing.how often do you use it and do you ever use it as a replacement for normal floss?I use it every day and it is a replacement for me. Unless I have a lot between my teeth, due to corn, meat, etc. Then I floss first with normal floss, then brush, and finally I use the water flosser.Yes please tell us more about water flossers. Do you floss then water floss? Do you have problems keeping them clean? Id say this is my biggest concern: mold growing in the parts. My mom keeps urging me to get one. I regular floss after I eat anything.See also one comment above. I have a tooth brush which I use for the parts to clean when I think it\\'s time :D every now and then I used the invisalign crystal (only some from the package) and dissolved it in warm water, waited a little bit and let it go through. I now use a discaler, but it\\'s also possible to use vinegar.\\nI never thought about mold, but I always remove the water and let it try. \\nI only eat twice a day and only floss once a day.Thank you! So the water comes out after each use? I\\'m curious about the descaled. I\\'ll have to look into that. We have hard water.I have an travel water flosser (no space for a big one xD) so it is really easy to empty the water. In my area we also have hard water, so a water cooker etc gets really white after some time.I definitely vote braces. I am a very responsible and disciplined adult and I often dont want to put my Invisalign back in or am tempted to leave them out for awhile so I can eat and drink. She wont have the option to not comply with treatment if she has braces.Ive had braces twice when younger and now finishing up invisalign as an adult. From what youve described, your daughter should go with braces.I had both, I also had huge issues with dental hygiene at 14 (when I had braces) and I have adhd. Invisalign is only successful if you stay on top of everything - hygiene, wearing them, not losing them, not staining them, etc etc. I recommend braces and switching to 3 month cleanings at the dentist. (It may be more expensive but way less money than a single root canal)Ive had both! Braces at 14 and then again at 25. Finally, Invisalign at 29! (Its been a wild ride with my teeth!). I think for a teenager braces are a much better option. I love my Invisalign and its much more comfortable than braces, but it can be hard as far as compliance goes. I think a teenager doesnt have the same discipline to keep putting aligners back in and I would go with braces for that sole reason. Theres also not the same social stigma related to a teenager getting braces.braces are the better choice, at least when you get braces, you\\'ll need to meet your ortho more frequent than Invisalign\\n\\nAnd with Invisalign, she must remove and input it everyday it\\'s harder than flossing, I SWEAR.Hi, I had both. Braces when I was in my late teens and Invisalign now in my late 20s „ \\n\\nThat being said, I think braces would work best in your daughters situation especially since she has ADHD and œnot the best oral hygiene\\x9d. I remember when I was a teen, I could eat literally all day long. With Invisalign, you really need to keep them on for as long as possible. Thankfully, Im also intermittent fasting at the moment and Im not snacking between meals. So if shes forgetful, she can definitely forget to put them back in or lose them. I havent lost any of my trays personally, but just from being on this subreddit, I know it can cost $200+ for a replacement tray. \\n\\nIf anything, maybe you can get her an invisible retainer after shes done with her treatment. I had a metal one and that thing was so obnoxious to wear since it covers the roof of your mouth. I never wore it hence why I have Invisalign as an adult lol. But my husband had braces growing up and a clear retainer and that seemed to work for him.If you\\'re going for invisalign I would wait. Obviously see what\\'s covered by insurance but it\\'s a couple years of cleaning everything 3 times a day.If she cant be responsible enough to care for the Invisalign she needs traditional braces. Otherwise your money will just be thrown away. Probably also ask for a permanent retainer when its done.Unless she needs major jaw, palate or bite correction before her jaw finishes growing, I would wait until she is done growing. My stepdaughter had crowding on her top front canine and by 18 her upper palate had grown enough for them to straighten. I had braces very young and now I\\'m in invisalign and massive dental work to correct the damage from being an irresponsible child in braces with a head that wasn\\'t done growing. Many adults are in invisalign due to young braces or being irresponsible with retainers. See a good orthodontist and discuss your commitment to using them when she is older, and what things need to be addressed now. Teeth are expensive and it\\'s a shame my parents spent $5,000 just to cause issues that are costing me $20,000This is really interesting. I had a ton of orthodontic work starting at 10 years old and was pretty much in retainers/palette expanders/braces until I was like 16/17. I had 4 extractions and my wisdom teeth out. Then I wore my retainers almost every single night for 9 years, even replacing retainers when they no longer fit. My teeth still moved and my bite shifted and Im in Invisalign now at 25. I went to a new orthodontist, and his main theory was that my jaw structure changed when I grew (I grew about 4 inches post braces) and my teeth had shifted with that. I do think my teeth wouldve been much worse if I hadnt had all that work done, but its frustrating because of all the time in money I put into my original treatment. My older siblings teeth came out beautifully though, and we got a discount because we used the orthodontist so much lol. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend braces over Invisalign for a 14 year old. Its a tough commitment that I think would be difficult esp in school all day.Ditto over hereI started at 8! I had extractions and palate expanders and braces until 16. My current dentist says he\\'d love to strangle that ortho. He was abusive too. Fired every lady in the office by yelling during my appointment once, left my wires off until the next appointment, at which there was a whole new office of ladies. At 16 he told my mother my mouth was a genetic disaster and he was moving away. He removed my brother\\'s and my braces, gave us invisalign like retainers and was gone. I was left with no eye teeth,  just gaps where they should be (I am genetically missing 6 adult teeth, I still have baby molars he didn\\'t rip out) the retainers were trash in 3 months. My brothers teeth look terrible now too. It has taken me until 42yo to trust dentists and feel safe giving them my money. My childhood dentist was a crook too, my mom was terrible at picking them. I got what my current dentist assumes was my insurance limit of fillings twice a year until I was 18 and uninsured. Then I quit going for obvious reasons. But here I am, 26 years later without a single new cavity. I magically got strong enamel without seeing a dentist!definitely bracesIt sounds to me like compliance will be more of an issue than hygiene. Invisalign demands more committed brushing and flossing, since the trays will trap debris. I would also expect that you\\'ll be dealing with lost trays. I\\'d go for traditional braces. They\\'re much harder to lose and are more forgiving of unfaithful hygiene habits.A lot of orthodontists will allow you to switch to braces if your daughter is not doing well with Invisalign. Shes going to have to be compliant with her retainers anyways, why not start that habit with invisalign now rather than risking relapse if shes not compliant with her retainers? If shes already struggling with hygiene, are you sure shell take extra care to brush with those? Why not give it a shot so she can brush and floss normally to see if it works?Water floss and ultrasound brush are a must IMHO.what is an ultrasound brush?An electric toothbrush, essentially. Most have multiple brush settings and do so much more work than a traditional toothbrush which relies on you to \"brush correctly.\"ah, thanks. I thought I missed out on something haha.Braces!!!I had braces almost 10 years ago and now Invisalign (my teeth shifted due to a tooth dying from an accident) but go with braces. Looking back in time I would have never been able to handle Invisalign at 14. Its quite a commitment and can easily be thrown away (we all know a kid in HS who accidentally tossed a retainer lol) or forgotten to be put back in. Go with the braces!Invisalign requires a lot of discipline. If she doesn\\'t follow it as she should, you are just throwing a LOT of money awayBraces definitely. \\n\\nKeep in mind that oral hygiene is still important, brushing in between the attachments etc. Got braces when I was 12/13 and had them for 2-3 years, I was terrible in brushing between attachments, the dentist never sent me to hygienist and got some staining - I was really insecure smiling for years.\\n\\nFrom my perspective, Invisalign is great as you must brush and fix it at once, but I am not sure whether this is suitable for teenagers as it comes with a lot of commitment and responsibility. Personally, I probably wouldnt have managed it with Invisalign in my teenage years. \\n\\nGood luck with finding suitable treatment!Braces and a Waterpik!Braces would probably be best for her. As an adult I found the upkeep of invisalign very exhausting after awhile. Plus the added responsibility of not losing the trays. As a teen I 100% would have lost my trays considering I threw out my retainer after lunch multiple times when I was young. I personally feel like invisalign is way more of responsibility than braces.I would go with braces and then be on top of her about her retainer after! She\\'s young enough where it\\'s really not weird to have braces at her age. I am currently in college doing smile direct club because it works for me better. I don\\'t have to go to the ortho to get braces tightened and just switch my retainers when I need to. But I\\'m also paying for myself so I do a really good job taking care of them.

Some people go from 14 days to 7 to 5 to 3.i dont think its that severe its just upside down i guessOr should I get the unlimited trays option for 1750$ moreUnlimited would make me feel better, personally.  Although, I would shop around if possible. My Comprehensive plan (Unlimited) is costing me $3,250 thanks to discounts from my provider. \\n\\nGranted, my current plan is only 18 trays. But I don't mind paying for the possibility of needing a ton of refinements. \\n\\nDon't think I will. But who knows. LolBraces hands down. Ive been in these things for almost 2 years now when it wouldve been done in months with braces and I have a less severe case than you.Is it because the teeth werent tracking correctly in your case?Theyve tracked correctly the whole time. I had a serious overbite and its just taken that long and elastics to fix.I have a small overbite but my bottom teeth are crowded and I hit my top front teeth with a chair in 6th grade or something to they are pointed inwardsAh, I didnt realize the video was upside down. It looked like a really bad underbiteSo I should go with the aligners instead? since my teeth are always visible when I talk I really dont want metal in my teethOnly you can decide. If it were me, Id still probably do braces because theyre quicker. But if you really want to avoid them, up to youI worked with an orthodontist today who swears by fixed braces for pretty much everything, and would only like to do Invisalign with patients that previously had braces but have relapsed slightly (so very minor movements required) because from his experience, Invisalign just isn't that good with anything complex. He also uses Spark (as you have with your clincheck here) and rates it similar to Invisalign.\\n\\nYou've got a lot of arch widening to do, aligners would most likely take longer than forecast for that kind of movement so if you can go for fixed braces, you may get a better result. Plus, it's cheaper. And you can eat with them :DMy ortho actually lets us eat with the aligners - but nothing hard or hot. I actually prefer eating with them in, because the buttons rub badly. Then i just remove and brush them afterIf you're changing weekly then that can be okay, but it is possible to crack the aligners by eating with them in. So yeah, soft stuff.I'm on weekly, yes. But i now take them out to eat, because it hurts less ‚[deleted]bro its upside downOhhh lol sorrysorry for what i fell for it aswell heheI was like, oh no, theyre gonna waste money ¢Braces cause the admin and headspace of Invisalign is painfulFuck Invisalign.

Consults are free. See if they all say the same thing about your recommended treatment plan. Pick the orthodontist you feel the most confident about their approach AND comfortable with.\\n\\nI did comprehensive and I'm so happy I did. It's super expensive -- but totally worth every penny. I also adore my orthodontist. He's the nicest person and really cares and takes the time to talk things through with me. I found him because he did my 8 year old niece's metal braces at the time. He specializes in kids -- but I just felt the most comfortable talking to him about my concerns and his office staff is so incredibly nice. I'm in tray 15/27.  I have zero regrets -- and I'm super happy with my progress so far. \\n\\nBonus: my ortho happily agreed to take my attachments off for my friend's wedding in July. I'm in the bridal party, so I want to take them off for the weekend.

By the time we notice it, its usually a pretty moderate shift. That takes quite a few trays and a lot of time to get everything perfect again. Some might have shifted just a few mm and that takes a few trays for that one tooth for example. The trays all add up and if you dont get comprehensive, the cost of that all adds up too. If you get a Lite treatment, youll fix the obvious problem but then youll notice everything else thats wrong and youll be paying extra to correct those issues and they will drive you absolutely nuts trust me. If youre going to do anything, so comprehensive. One cost, 5 years, completely unlimited trays :)Looks like your bite might be off in that picture. That takes a lot of trays to correct. The alignment is also an obvious issue. The top teeth look like theyre bowed into each other so they would be rotated. The midline is also way off so that would be shifted which also takes time. \\n\\nThe bottom teeth are the most obvious. I only used to ever notice my top 2, but now I realise how ignorant I was being saying my bottom teeth were œabsolutely fine\\x9d because they just werent. I completely understand the way youre thinking and only noticing the biggest aesthetic issue though, and you never realise how œbad\\x9d your teeth used to be until you do Invisalign lolThank you for that. I kind of shifted my typical bite so my bottom teeth could be seen in the photo, but regardless, needs a lot of work for sure. My top front teeth are slightly protruding in front of the others so I noticed that as well. But yeah; bottom teeth are all jacked up lol. Thank you again.

It isn't easy the first few days of new trays, but there are less ortho visits which was a bonus for me. There aren't limits to what you can eat (well, unless your teeth are sore) which I liked as well.\\n\\nYou will be able to see the attachments and they'll be rough on your mouth at first, but you'll get used to them! You will likely get annoyed when you're hanging out with people and need to decide if you're taking those puppies out or swishing water constantly. (I'm cavity prone, so I need to take them out! Even with crazy good hygiene I got 2 cavities!) You also gotta be really responsible with your trays. You can't lose braces like you can lose invisalign and it can honestly be gross at times (dropping a tray on my bathroom floor and cleaning it thoroughly multiple times before putting it back in my mouth still skeeves me out just remembering it, I couldn't imagine if it was any sort of public restroom!)\\n\\nAlso, do not bank on losing weight!! Some people do lose but others gain because they binge when their trays are out! I only take my trays out twice a day, once to brush in the morning and once to eat dinner at night, because I hate taking them out (more because I'm lazy than pain) and I definitely go a little nuts on food.\\n\\nI'm sure there are things I'm forgetting, but keep all of this in mind when deciding!Braces were better as a teen for me because I didn't have to pop them out to eat like how I do with Invisalign.\\n\\nI feel that Invisalign is better for adults because they have more control of time in their lives to take care of their teeth where students are always on a tight schedule.definitely dont use weight loss as a factor in the decision. many of us dont lose weight and some\\ngain weight. its absolutely not guaranteedHello. As long as you are serious about following your orthodontists instructions and wearing your trays 20-22 hours per day, Invisalign should be a great choice.  Pretty much everyone seems to get attachments.  I've got them on most of my teeth and don't find they are particularly noticeable especially when the retainers are in.  I'd say go for it, particularly considering you have the option to switch to braces for free if you find you are not happy with Invisalign. What's there to lose?Ask your orthodontist about getting the attachments on the inside / tongue side of the front teeth. Mine does that most of the time and she is an experienced provider.

I think Ill be able to get to a result that Im satisfied with.\\n- This next point isn't relevant to 99% of you since I had a special case but I had extreme bone and gum loss and had to get a bone and gum graft in October or November (I can't remember the dates exactly now, it was a multi phase surgery). After my surgery I was switching trays twice a week rather than once a week, so I got through my first set of 46 trays by March.

Before I had wider smile, rounder face. Now with narrow jaw after 2 teeth extraction my face looks alot skinnier. Im totally unhappy with it and started Invisalign to tip them out a bit. Hopefully it would be better. Wish me luck pls![deleted]Before on the left photos. After on the right and 3rd, 4th photosThey tilted in your teeth excessively to close the spaces, so now they are at the wrong angle. The angle for teeth is 105 degrees. These teeth are like 80 degrees, tilted inward.\\n\\nIt suggests that you had little or no crowding before, so in order to close the enormous spaces left by extractions (I say enormous, because if you had no or little crowding, the spaces are at least 8 mm,  plus your teeth seem big, so extra big spaces) they had to shrink everything in, tilt in the teeth, and narrow the dental arches.  This makes the smile narrow, and that makes the cheeks narrow. It may have also made your mouth retrude slightly into your face, and made your chin look a tiny bit more behind.  It may also be the cause of the gummy smile, unless that was there before?\\n\\nMany people have experienced this; you can check QUORA, there is a thread on this issue there of \"tilted in teeth\" after extraction/retraction.\\n\\nWhat can you do about it? First ask for your money back.  The wrong angle of the teeth is by itself a justification.  Second, the only way to get your full smile back is to open up the extraction spaces (if you still can, given that the dental arch has shrunk, and the bone is now gone where the teeth once were) and torque the teeth back out.   It is possible, many have done it, but it is a huge hassle, costs a lot of money (which is why you need your money back), and may even require bone grafting.  Plus not many orthodontists are willing to do it (maybe yours would?).\\n\\nThe good news is that since you were an adult when you had it done you did not get any jaw growth recession, so you are in the best position to \\'change it\\', if you want to go through the hassle  of opening spaces (for implants) and if you do find an ortho willing to do it.   Tilting the teeth out alone yes will help make the occlusion look better, and give some more fullness to your smile, but will not restore the width of the arch, or give back your facial fullness.  You need to get the teeth (implants) and alveolar bone back to do that.  Teeth and bone support the soft tissue: the skin and the face.\\n\\nThere is a model in Romania who had the same thing happen to her, and she was upset for her career. She ended up having success by opening up the spaces again, and she has said (on some post somewhere on Reddit, three years ago) that she is satisfied with how her face became. BUt she really needed to do all this reversal for her career.  It really is a pain.  \\n\\nSo if you can get your teeth to tilt out normally again, already that would be a plus.   And maybe that will be enough to make you happy.  You are lucky you were already so attractive, and still are.Hi Thomas, thank you so much for your input and suggestion. However I dont wanna go thru traditional braces again plus implants. Its too much for me, would make me depressed. Right now Im on 30 weeks Invisalign to tip teeth number 3,4,5 on each side outward. Hopefully that would make the arch looks wider and fuller. If it still looks narrow I will ask for the refinement to wider the arch with Invisalign ( if my ortho says its possible) Then filler on the face maybe?!? What is your thought on that? I appreciate your response. Thanks!ask your ortho to round out the arches as much as possible as well as advance.\\n\\nI don\\'t like the idea of fillers.   Why fiddle with and punish your lovely face more?\\n\\nJust know and accept that none of this was your fault, so don\\'t take it personally (even if it is your face) and don\\'t be upset at your own face for something someone did to you, by incorrect and ignorant planning.\\n\\nTake your new face that coems from the Invisalign treatment as a sign of YOUR fighting back and  be proud of dealing with something that is very difficult to deal with.  I get upset by bad haircuts;  hate people making decisions on my face.  But bad haircuts and orthodontic treatment that changes faces happens all the time, and we are not warned....and we can\\'t really do much about it.   I do think accepting what you can get with the tilting will be the best option.  You have too many gifts (if your looks are an indication) to waste your time on earth being concerned with fillers!Ill take your advises. Thanks for your encouraging words! \\x9dï¸\\x8fI had 4 teeth extracted and same. It made me ugly.  If I could go back I rather my beautiful face and crooked teeth then sunken face.

You made a sacrifice, but gained the smile you wanted. ºï¸\\x8fIf I could go back, I wouldnt let him extract my teeth.

I hope it stops happening to you!This terrifies me - how the heck do you have so many refinements?? That sounds like your treatment plan just didn\\'t work at all or made things significantly worse?!refinements are just trays after a scan at the end of the initial set of trays. I wish they didn\\'t call them refinements because that implies that you\\'re done with treatment and just tweaking things, which is not the case. Refinements are often expected (I knew from the beginning that my initial set of trays was only going to be the first 6 months of treatment).The first set moved my front teeth, top and bottom into place. I asked the ortho to explain exactly why I had so many refinements (I wasnt thrilled with the number, either) and he showed me how theyll be moving some of my back teeth into place and improving my bite. I wasnt worried about my back teeth or bite originally, but the clincheck showed me the changes and I get it. I was disappointed that I did 6 months initially and saw the changes I was looking for, and now 9 more monthsbut that aligns with the 18 months or possibly less that he originally estimated.Haha, thanks!

Also sick of hearing at every cleaning œIf you dont get these 2 teeth straightened youre going to start experiencing bone loss!\\x9dSame.

Now Im an adult with less molars and weak painful wisdom teeth and need Invisalign anyways. This is horrible. Why would a dentist remove five molars? Even if they had cavities or something, short of them rotting out of your mouth what the hellMy mom was a single mom and couldnt afford orthodontic treatment for me unfortunately our dentist was also a Polish friend of hers who said that removing teeth was protocol back in the day apparently to make space and then they would have you wear a retainer for a while. It was truly awful to go through that when I was probably eight or nine years old and it didnt make any difference except cause me pain and now my other molars are weaker as a result and Im stuck with wisdom teeth two of which had to be removed anywaysAnother one in that boat!

I am 30 now and just started my first tray on 11/2. The total was 6100, my insurance covered 1500 and I got 300 off because its the same place I got my braces. So out of pocket I am spending 4300.Just under 4k. I had braces for 2.5 yrs, ages 14-16. I was pretty good about wearing my retainer at night for the first 2 yrs, then I wore only periodically for 5 yrs. Im in my early 40s. My teeth are still pretty straight, but I have a slight overbite and cross bite. Im on 7 of 19 trays, not sure how many refinements I will need.Thank you!Meeeee tooooo!  Nobody ever told me I had to wear it FOREVER! UghAny time I\\'ve told someone I\\'m doing invisalign they ask, \"did you have braces growing up?\" (I did not) And it\\'s happened enough that I\\'m like damn what happened to yall lolI feel like every year I see younger and younger kids wearing braces.I had braces as a teenager and remember asking my orthodontist to remove them before I was done and he did. \\n\\nHere I am 30 years later and my orthodontist is correcting the overbite that I have been living ever since! But it is worth it. I am ready to be compliant now when I wasnt as a teenagerI really dont understand this, where i live(the Netherlands). Everyone that had braces has a glued in retainer, why dont they use those everywhere?My permanent (glued) retainer started breaking after a few years”theyre not really permanentRetainers for rest of the life ? \\nSomebody tell me thats not trueI mean, your teeth got crowded/crooked/whatever for a reason. That reason normally hasn\\'t disappeared just because you addressed the symptom by straightening your teeth (unless you had jaw surgery or something). If you don\\'t keep the teeth where they\\'ve moved to with a retainer, they\\'ll move back to where they were before.Well often time wisdom tooth is the culprit for crowding of teeth. When it pops out it pushes rest of the arch forward.\\nBut still alligners for whole blumming life ? \\nShould\\'ve just replaced my one crooked tooth then going for alligners lolI haven\\'t had wisdom teeth for 30 years,my teeth only started crowding within the last few years. Crowding happens with age also. Retainers for life is pretty normal for most people who\\'ve needed orthodontics.thinking about getting invisalign for myself and the thought of retainers for the rest of my life is really making this hard  idk first world problems I guess but wtf If I wore a damn invisalign thing for a year plus to get my teeth straight, it should just be done after that lmao idk I smoke ouid so its hard imagining successfully remembering a retainer every night also lolIm in my mid 40s and had braces in middle school. I had just had the bottom cemented-in retainer from my teenage years removed on the same day I got my Invisalign. And my new orthodontist confirmed Ill have cemented retainers on the top and bottom plus Invisalign retainers forever. Teeth want to go back to their original position. Without wearing retainers forever, youre teeth will move.Ugh, yes.  I got my braces off in 6th grade...started in fourth grade.  I have been so embarrassed by my apparent inability--as an 11-year-old!--to manage to keep my teeth straight!  Now I\\'m paying the same amount my parents paid for my original braces to fix it.I\\'m in this group. Even when I went for my consult, they asked me why Invisalign? I said I had braces and never wanted to go through that again. Then she said \"and back then they didn\\'t know you had to wear a retainer for life. 1-2 years is what they said, right?\" And I\\'m thinking yup. And the Ortho who\\'s doing my Invisalign was probably one of those docs that said 1-2 years back then. And now making a killing doing round 2 for all those that have to redo it. I\\'m just glad my parents aren\\'t pissed at wasted money spent. At least my teeth were straight for about 15 years (I had my retainer off and on all those years).My teeth were not corrected properly the first time I had braces. Now I am doing it againSame!!!This is exactly my story! I got my braces off at peak angsty teenager years. I think I wore them once. Then forgot about them and they collected dust on my shelf.i wore my retainers until i was 30! and my teeth shifted like crazy after my second child was born. fml. here i am with invisalign and my teeth hurt like a mf-er.My wife and I were just talking about this - what is so hard about a retainer? She has had one since childhood and she wears it 99% of the time during our 12 years relationship. I had a bite guard for night time before braces and it never bothered me to wear every time.Me tooIm part of the œmy parents couldnt afford to pay for ortho treatment as a kid. Always wanted straighter teeth, so at 23 I said fuck it! Im getting braces\\x9d \\nI love this subreddit I wanted Invisalign but braces were cheaperƒI had braces as an adult. I had permanently bonded wires across the backs of my front six teeth and thought that meant I didnt have to wear my retainer too. My teeth shifted and I found myself in Invisalign a decade after braces came off. Wore Invisalign for 9 weeks and am religious about my retainer now. I learned my lesson.I\\'m paying for the permanent retainer for my stepdaughter for this exact reason.Im in the I had knock-off Invisalign a few years ago which didnt do the job and now im having the real deal gang[deleted]C thru smiles. It was absolute dogshit in comparison to Invisalign.I\\'m a bit embarrassed by this, but I had a huge bulky plastic orthodontic device thingy as a kid (you were supposed to wear it at night mainly, you couldn\\'t really even speak when wearing it), but I wasn\\'t compliant wearing it and quit the treatment before my bite and teeth were fixed ¬ As a kid I just pretty much wanted nothing to do with dentists, and thus really didn\\'t care about wearing that thing at all. I remember it was really bulky and uncomfortable though and made me nauseous, but mostly I just didn\\'t understand why would it be important to have perfectly straight teeth/a good bite since I felt like my mouth is functional enough. And alas, now as an adult I need to pay for my stupidity.. …This is me exactly! Just went in for my consultation. \\n\\nBack when I was a kid,, I don\\'t remember being told that I should wear retainers at night forever. I lost my retainers years ago. The top one never, ever showed up. I had no idea that I could/should go back and get another one, and if I did, I probably didn\\'t have the money back then.\\n\\nAfter more than 35 years, my underbite has returned. My teeth have crowded some. Plus, there are so many things they can do now that they couldn\\'t back then with bonding, etc, to make your teeth look great.\\n\\nI had jaw surgery back in 1983 (I think?). Now I\\'m seeing a lot of people whose underbites can actually be corrected with invisalign. It\\'s amazing!  I can\\'t wait to get mine and get started again.Started my orthodontic treatment in Grade 5 (something about widening my bite - had to tighten it every night and boy that hurt), then had braces from Year 9-12 with jaw surgery to correct an overbite and they removed my wisdom teeth in the process. \\n\\n6 years after my braces came off and Im back for more - in the form of Invisalign. Yes I lost my retainer but I also had a wire on my bottom teeth and DESPITE this they still moved and I now have a tiny overbite again. Was informed this would have happened even if I wore my retainer religiously.\\n\\nHow is this fairrrrr god damn.Yup, I got a cavity filled and my retainer didnt fit anymore so I said oh well! Now here I am on 2 of 14 trays lolWhen I was a 12 I threw a fit and refused to get braces. My teeth were essentially straight, but I had a horrible overbite. Things got very contentious between parents and ortho, but eventually I convinced my dad (who never had braces) to back me.\\n\\n10 years later, paying 6K for Invisalign and spent over 3K so far on various tmj and migraine treatments.

In my case, each tooth behind them needs to slide back one by one to make space for the crooked teeth to go back to their correct spot. Id guess thatll be your treatment plan too. No harm in getting a second opinion though! Get a consultation at another dentist or orthodontist before you fully commit.Yeah same situation with similar teeth. 16 months for mine. Im 7 months in and so far its mostly been making space so the changes arent super noticeable outside of your bite. But the time goes quick and its worth it!Yea I suppose this would make sense, but my dentist said I would be getting IPR to make room which I thought wouldve done the jobmy ortho estimated 1.5 years for me but i only received 25 trays and im on weekly changes. im skeptical if my bite will be 100% by the end though, well seeSounds ideal with the weekly changes, hopefully my initial amount of trays will be similar!Your teeth look similar-ish to how mine were before starting.   I had a œcant\\x9d as well where the right side was higher than left (due to adolescent braces and surgery).   I started in Dec 2020 and I have an estimated 12 weeks left in refinements.   My estimate was 18-24 months so I could be a bit earlier.    The time goes quickly, hang in there!I also have a slightly slanted jaw, as you can see more gum on one side! Suppose I was expecting a shorter time, but will be worth the resultsI got quoted the same timing and while i believe my teeth need more work than yours, its important to remember that its a slow process. And thats a good thing.In my experience I was underestimated. I am on refinements (8 trays) now after 22 initial trays that took longer than expected. I guess its so you dont rush the movements and potentially cause issues with the teeth roots (I am not a dentist but this was the feeling I got about why things take so long to move).Youre so close to the end now, did those initial trays have 2 week changes? Yea seems like all my teeth will be moving and not those that are crooked which is what i initially thoughtYea they had to move a lot of mine to make room and adjust my bite. They gave me IPR and a load of attachments first round. Every tray was 2 weeks unless I wasnt tracking and so I left them in longer then. The refinement round I have had most attachments removed and just needed a few new ones, but no more IPR was needed as I had enough room for the last changes.\\n\\nIf Im happy with the aesthetics of this I just need to know what the final bite at the back is like - right now its gone pretty open since all the other changes.Just visited your page, you have such nice teeth! My bite now feels good so Im worried it will change and make my molars not touch. I also have to get IPR but worried about gaps between my teeth, probably from some bad results on here\\n\\nLook forward to seeing your results will keep me motivated for sure \\x81Thanks, I can only see the negatives of my teeth I think after so long looking at them! Ive struggled a lot with this process partly because of pregcy and having a newborn during the process too, not ideal! Eating in more of a rush and cleaning afterwards was the hardest bit.\\n\\nYours will be great, as a guess but I dont think from seeing them that you would have many issues at all. Any teeth I needed pushed back did it no issues. Pulling them down and forwards was the hard bit!\\n\\nIPR gaps werent an issue for me - I only had one noticeably visible one, and that disappeared within 3-4 days. So hopefully youll have the same experience.\\n\\nHeres to us both getting this done!They overprojected my treatment plan by a year and a half.. my teeth werent that bad either and I only have 24 initial trays.. I think they take into account refinements but I still dont see mine being anywhere close to 2 years. I kinda hypothesized that it also may be to charge more? But not sure.Yea I was charged the full comprehensive plan, thought they would recommend lite but unfortunately not. Hopefully its over-projected like yours, I guess the amount of initial trays will tell!You might have only been given the first 24 of your initial set. You might end up with more of the first set before you get refinements? Time will tell :)I got 12 at first, then just went last week and got the other 12. She said I will be rescanned for the refinements in April after Im done with these 12.. so ·\\x8f¼\\x8dï¸\\x8fMy ortho underestimated, he said 12-18, its already been 24 ‚ask about getting an Acceledent. I got prescribed one and did 26 trays in 93 days. Could potentially get you to around 6-9 monthsAnother very similar device goes by the name of V-Pro (manufactured by Propel Orthodontics). Theyre both devices that essentially vibrate in a way to help facilitate faster teeth movement (and, in my case, it helps reduce soreness on those œnew tray\\x9d days - its like a mouth massage).Thanks, not heard of Acceledent but will give it a googleI cant recommend it enough. Its RX only but my ortho had them on hand. Charged me 499 for it but it was worth every penny. I used it 20 minutes before bed and changed my trays ever 84 hoursA cheaper way to do it is to buy a 10 dollar Chinese mini vibrator and vibrate over your arches. Same hertz level.think ill stick to my FDA approved one ‚¦\\x8d‚ï¸\\x8fThey generally underestimate it. You do have a moderate bite problem though and that takes ages to fix. Id say youll be done in a couple years including refinements.Really? Ive just posted again because i thought my bite was normal. Let me know what you thinkIt looks like you have a deep bite. Your top front teeth need to be pulled forward into alignment and then upwards. Thatll take a few months to get it perfect.Mine are slightly worse as I have an overjet and pretty bad crowding on the bottom. I needed 2 extractions and was estimated 18-24 months with 56 trays and weekly changes. If you do the math thats 13ish months. After lurking in this sub I was shocked that it would take that long! Especially with some people being done in 6mo with teeth that didnt look far off mine. I asked my ortho and she said that they factor in extra time for refinements after the initial trays so it could take longer or shorter depending on how my teeth move. They also said I will only probably need up to tray 50 and then Ill be rescannedYea it seems the initial amount of trays is always less that their prediction, so like you said must counter in refinements. Ive definitely seen some more misaligned teeth being done in 6mo, guess they were just lucky cases!It looks to me like you may have a posterior open bite on each side or your teeth dont line up properly enough to have a solid bite. I had one on my left side and pretty straight teeth (had metal braces as a kid as well but was not responsible with retainers) and im sadly going on a year and a half of treatment and over 50 trays. Open bites take longer than just fixing crooked teeth. Things are looking and feeling great though, so I dont regret it. You wont either!I thought I had a normal bite aha, Ive posted my bite on a separate post let me know what you think. Starting will be the hardest but hopefully wearing them just becomes routine and the time will fly by!Youre right, your sides look fine! Sorry it was hard to tell in the first photos. Your bite looks a bit deep but they can fix that. The bite issues take more trays for sure but you will be happy with your results! Good luckmy teeth started out similarly, other than one tooth out of place at the top and some overcrowding in the bottom since my wisdom teeth, I thought they were pretty good! at the beginning I was quoted 5 months - now it has  been 9 months and I\\'m still going (waiting to see how long a second round of refinements will take). I think I personally would have preferred they overestimated and it would be a nice surprise if it finished early... rather than underestimating and it taking more  double the time I was originally quoted!Anything under a year is pretty good going in my eyes, hopefully youll be finished soon. I agree that Id rather they overestimate, I just hope that is the case!Did you have premolar extractions the first time around?  I ssk because your smile seems a little narrow and the teeth tilted inward.  Why are you getting a second round?  Did crowding in the lower arch result?No extractions when I had metal braces. This will be my first round of invisalign, mainly to straighten both lateral incisors.Well my teeth definitely looked worse to start, I only had 14 trays planned but now nearing the end of that, could have 5-10 refinements. So honestly I\\'d SAY that seems long but I\\'m not an orthodontist and there is probably a reason for that length, perhaps spacing etc. \\n\\nThe guys at Invisalign should determine for you once you do the clincheck, don\\'t think it\\'s just your ortho\\'s opinion. Also just an fyi, it seems to me that they\\'re pretty logical and fair and not biased in the ways of money or anything, any more than 14 initial aligners would have been an extra Â500 for me to pay and I\\'ll have had more than 14 after the refinements and won\\'t charge me more. Or I hope they won\\'t at least lol.Yea the 14 aligner plan wouldve been Â700 less, but any additional trays would have added cost. So Im glad Ive gone with comprehensive to get the most out of it. Are you on fornightly changes?Hmmm, not sure how it works exactly then, it would\\'ve been Â500 for me. My ortho just said from the beginning, might need 14 or less and that\\'d be cheaper, didn\\'t really ask if I wanted to choose or say that it\\'d cost more for refinements. Didn\\'t mention it when I was getting a new impression for them either, so I\\'m gonna assume they won\\'t charge me more, be a bit ballsy if I go there next and they suddenly say \"that\\'ll be Â___\" lol. \\n\\nI\\'m not no, started off with about 10 days. Ortho said \"to be honest bud you\\'d probably be fine dropping down to 7 days\", and for the trays that I did that, I was, no extra pain or bad fitting or anything. Probably go back to 7 days on the next ones if I can, as long as it doesn\\'t need to be more and all goes well, should be okay. I\\'m a smoker so my trays get stained before a week is up anyways so nice to change to a fresh set lol.they gave me an estimate of 18 months. i only have 23 trays with weekly changes after tray 8, ill be done with my initial 23 trays in 6 months time but im sure i will need refinements since almost everyone does. i genuinely dont know how they come up with the number of months they give you lolThis gives me hope, just hope invisalign estimates lower number of trays for the initial roundMine estimated 24 months but then i got 44 weekly trays (like 10.5 months)This is what I needed to hearI thought I need only the front two teeth to fix as they were sticking out and slightly crooked. However, dentist told me it would be a year time treatment. I had 27 trays first and then 16 refinements for a total of a year (not counting the dead times). Thats the power of orthodontic. Makes you think you dont need that much and your teeth need some slight correction. In reality theres much more to do and ones teeth are never as straight as they would think. Same to me..Im finished now and the change is amazing, never thought my teeth were that bad and they could become so good. Ppl were genuinely telling me œyour teeth are already straight\\x9d not knowing the Invisalign results. Now they wouldnt say the same. So yeah, its going to take long time but it is how it is and I prefer take long time rather then rushing and have teeth problems afterI\\'m confused, your teeth look perfect to me. Mine are super messed up and they estimated 6-9 months plus refinements. A big fat lie.For me its the two lateral incisors which have rotated. I know if I dont fix it now they will continue to move as my teeth are v similar to my mums. Well I wish I was in your position, Id think it unlikely they would underestimate your treatment time but who knowsDid you get to see that little 3d visualisation of the movements? I\\'d be so interested to see that if I were you, cause really to rotate the two teeth, I\\'m clueless with orthodontics,but really I d imagine 2 trays are enough …Not yet but going back in a few weeks to get the first trays fitted so hoping to see then! I think my dentist is looking to widen my smile aswell, so imagine thats what the majority of trays will aim to doI see. Makes sense than the length of treatment I supposeGreat.  Should not take longMine said 18 months to be safe but when I got my trays it was only 39 weeks lol Ill probably do refinements but its still way better than 18 monthsHoping to get the same thing then, less than 1 year is idealVibration is vibration-- just the accel and other payented versions created an easy way to have the vibration affect teeth.  On yout own trickier. \\n\\nI shared my idea with an orthodontist and he said I was right-- and also that the using the accel onky a few minutes a day did not make sense.

Wouldn\\'t braces be better for that?\\n\\n(Genuine question- I don\\'t have invisalign)Good to know, thank you!!!!Your teeth are perfect!!!!!! They look really good!Thank you! I appreciate the encouragement. Maybe I just need to cool my jets and wait till the process it over.Im in the same boat. 16/22 and a little happier but still not looking great. But I know I still have ways to go and havent even got to talk about refinements yet. But my teeth are similar to your issues too. You might look into bonding and contouring to fix the gaps and roughnessIts amazing what can happen in 10 aligners. I bet you will be happy after its done.Thanks for the positivity! Thats comforting.They look pretty damn gorgeous to me, and I work in dentistry. I\\'d see your smile and see nothing but beauty.Which one do you think is the snaggle tooth? I can\\'t tell.these teeth look perfect to me!!!!!! Im on tray 12 of 44 and I would kill for these teeth !!! I also dont see a single snaggle tooth?? °Aww, thanks friend! Yes, all the encouragement is making me appreciate how far they have come! Im excited to see the final result, and Im sure Ill be happy.If this is your end result you should be really happy.  I wouldn\\'t even call those real black triangles. For someone to have total contact there, it looks like fake veneers. This is good. Real teethYes chill brahDon\\'t expect perfection. Not even the best in the world are capable of that unless you want an entire new set of teeth. Everyone\\'s teeth are different, don\\'t expect braces or Invisalign to be the be all end all of perfect teeth. Maybe just lower your standards a tad bit. \\n\\nKeep in mind braces/invisalign are for aesthetics. Hence why insurance charges as such.How do those triangles get fixed? Is it only cosmetic or can complicate things furtherI had crowding on my bottom row, the triangles were a result from the IPR however, the triangles vary in size because a different file was used around the outer right tooth. I can get bonding or pinhole surgery to fix. Both easy fixes, but expensive.Ask for more ipr? I asked my ortho to fill in some gaps and they did it for me. I had 3 rounds of ipr on my front bottom and my teeth are pretty fine ans the gaps have closed up. Your teeth looks great I dont even know which was the snaggle tooth.Thank you! I will ask my ortho about that during the next visit. I never considered that we werent done with IPR just yet. I still have my refinement scan to go so we shall see.I had braces and they are the worst, plus you lose bone structure and your roots will lose size. I wish I would have done Invisalign before because I see the changes quicker and the pain is way less. Talk to your ortho and mention your concerns. It looks great to me, good luck!Does your bite close? Just be happy if it does! Because I had 42 trays of invisalign and 30 trays of refinments and my bite doesn\\'t close. ƒKeep hope and trust in your refinement journey. I did 15 trays plus 10 refinements. Initially was supposed to be 6 refinements, but I insisted to my dentist to let Invisalign know that the gaps being closed was critically important to me. They redid my ClinCheck and that\\'s how I ended up with 4 more. I couldn\\'t be happier. The key is to not move on to aligners until you\\'re happy because that closes your case and then you pay again. Also, you have the right to call Invisalign and talk to a specialist about your case, there\\'s always the possibility that your provider isn\\'t communicating what you want clearly. At worse, your oral anatomy won\\'t allow your teeth to be your version of perfect. But honestly, I think they look amazing so far and refinements will only further enhance that.They\\'re not perfect, but they are pretty good.  On an average day if we weren\\'t staring at all your teeth under a bright light, I bet they\\'d look perfect.Look good IMOI think your teeth look amazing ‘Œ‘ŒYoull probably have Refinements. Mine was a 100% case as my bite was soooo wrong 3/6 on refinements and the difference now is just amazing.hows your bite though? it looks like the canine is hitting the bottom toothWhats ipr?Filing in between teeth to create space for them to move/straighten. Was done on bottom row for my crowding. Will show before and after before i move to refinements so it makes more sense.Your teeth look great! I say trust the process, maybe the next couple of trays will fix the issueYour teeth look great to me!If the snaggle tooth gets fixed, then you should be very pleased. Trust me, I understand. I\\'m not thrilled with my results - Invisalign lite with Propel procedure. I have 2 more trays and was hoping for at least some (or lots) of refinements but dentist is like \"everything looks fantastic, blah blah...\" I get you though. For all the money, time and stress, we want a worthwhile result. American TV doesn\\'t help.It doesnt at all! But thanks for the encouragement! Again, Im sure Ill be happy, I just started my 19th tray and the power strips are definitely adding some pressure. I guess I dont understand how my ortho can look at my one remaining crooked front tooth and think this is complete. Reading the other comments, Im definitely going to address all of my concerns before they close my case.I swear you people on this sub want absolutely perfect teeth. Get veneers if you want that. Youre teeth look fine, you are just overthinking it. Orthodontic treatments main goal is not cosmetic anyway.If people are paying a large sum of money and undergoing this treatment, its ok to want perfect teeth. Dont make OP feel worseYes I agree. I paid a large sum of money as well to have better looking teeth. Cosmetics was the main driving force behind my Invisalign choice. However, I did not go into treatment expecting to achieve a œperfect\\x9d smile. It should be reiterated that everyones  teeth are unique and striving for that pinnacle of perfection is unhealthy because is can never be reached. It leads to situations like this where the teeth look objectively fine but the person is not satisfied due to very minute imperfections.Totally agree too! We do tend to hyper fixate on the little flawsI wound up getting 25 refinements. Maybe 10 is just the minimum?I have the moderate package, so technically mine come with only 1 set of refinements, which will be 10 trays “ and honestly, this shit was expensive so Im not paying more anymore than I already did but based on comments I think Ill just lower my expectations, lol and be happy with the final result.There\\'s no minimum, I\\'m working my way through a set of 6 refinement trays.Have you gotten refinements?What are refinements?

I think you do see the ortho more, so that could end up being your deciding factor.I did a 20 mile hike with Invisalign and that was a pain to pop them out to eat a clif bar. Sometimes Id just swish water and pop them back in. You have more appointments with braces. I see my ortho once very couple of months and I know braces is more like every 6 weeks. So I guess it depends if youre going to be gone to hike the AT or something and be gone for months, Id wait until after that trip. If you just like to travel and backpack for like a week then braces would probably be betterBRACES. Invis while traveling is a pain in the assI recently finished up Invisalign, and I am glad that the majority of my treatment was during lockdowns la. It was so easy to stick to the 22+ hours a day. Towards the end of treatment when I started going out more, I saw my compliance fall. I also am a big cyclist/hiker, and it was pretty annoying popping out trays to get some nutrition in during a big ride. All to say, sounds like braces might be the better option in your case.Thanks very much for your response. Would you mind telling me about your Invisalign routine while on a long ride? Thanks againI\\'d pop them out when I wanted to eat something, swish vigorously with water before putting them back, then brushed my teeth when I got back home. I never did any multi-day stuff though.Thanks for the routineI have Invisalign and havent had a hard time at all. That being said, the most difficult times I have had during my experience have been on long hikes. I hiked 70 miles of the Oregon coast trail on spring break and it was a pain in the ass. I couldnt really eat without stopping, flossing, brushing. I go on long distance hikes often and Im used to eating things as I walk. Its simply not possible with Invisalign.BracesI\\'m a big bike tourer. I\\'ve had both Invisalign and braces, but never while on a bike tour. That said, i would 100% choose Invisalign for this scenario. With braces you have to get them tightened every 4 or 6 weeks. With Invisalign you can find a provider who will see you every three or six months, or track your progress online. Provided that there are no issues of course. I would definitely wait a month before setting off on the trip so you can make sure all attachments are in order and not falling off. And check every tray before you go.\\n\\nBraces are also harder to floss and clean. Invisalign is a pain because you have to brush so often, but you can pop them off and do that anywhere it trip. It can be a hassle in the real world to find a bathroom and faucet on the go, but you won\\'t have that problem on a bike tour. But you will have to be vigilant about rinsing or brushing after all snacks and electrolyte drinks, even if it\\'s every two hrs. This is annoying, but doable on a bike tour.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\'s possible to go on a long trip with braces because of the ever 4-6 week appointments. Depends what you have planned. Good luck!This is sound advice.I agred with this 100%. I have had braces and invaslign and done bike tours and this is the correct answer.Thanks much - - I appreciate that you\\'ve actually had experience with both!Traditional braces 100%. \\n\\nFrom personal experience having to remove Invisalign is actually a bad thing, hygiene with braces is way easier you just have to rinse with water if something gets stuck. You could probably schedule appointments around your trips.Thanks - - could you provide a little detail on why removal of Invisalign was bad?It\\'s just plain annoying, I\\'ve been on a bike trip with a carriere motion appliance and a lower retainer (since my original ortho tricked me into it) and it was honestly miserable to have to take it out when I wanted to have a snack on the ride. It\\'ll suck even more if you\\'ll need rubber bands.\\n\\nI ended up dumping that ortho since he was rude and clearly didn\\'t care about me and ended up swapping out the carriere for braces with a new ortho and I\\'m much happier now. Maintece isn\\'t a pain at all, usually I can just swish with water and nothing stays stuck, and the aesthetics aren\\'t a big deal to me at all even as a college student especially since we get to wear masks. I would think appointments wouldn\\'t be a big deal unless you go on trips for several months at a time.Definitely braces. I cant imagine trying to manage Invisalign during all that.Braces. I think that 100%(I\\'m OP)  Thanks...but why?Its the commitment to cleaning and rinsing every time you eat or drink anything except water. Even as someone who worked from home the entire pandemic and is now on maternity leave this is still hard to maintain. A decent rinse and clean of teeth and trays every mealtime takes time and you need resources to wash and clean at. If this step was skipped Id be nervous of a cavity risk, especially with sugar/acid sitting on your teeth between the trays all day. Only water would reduce this risk but Im not sure that would be enough.\\n\\nEvery time you eat, you clean up the trays. This would get old pretty fast. \\n\\nTheres a very few risk of losing the trays while youre out, without easily being able to replace them this could delay treatment massively. \\n\\nIf I could do all this again Id go braces. Who cares what they look like, they can be brightly coloured and awesome. Clear trays arent ever completely invisible especially when youre covered in attachments on most teeth. That is another real thing that could happen - losing an attachment and not being able to easily get it fitted back on without an appointment.\\n\\nBraces just seem lower maintece, fewer things to lose or go wrong, and other than cleaning the braces, hygiene would be easier to work with.Thanks - - very compelling!Id go with Invisalign for sure. There arent any restrictions on what you can eat. When Im on a hike or climbing, I put some water in a cup and use that to brush. If youre on a backpacking trip, just bring along that set of aligners, along with some denture tablets to soak every morning. Youre only using an extra 15oz water a day, and can eat protein bars with ease.Thanks - - I appreciate the real life experienceClear aligners (not Invisalign). I have all my aligners and 3 sets of retainers. I dont œneed\\x9d to see my ortho at any specific time. Im tracked by the online uploads I do. If my tray snaps I just put in the next tray. If a wire breaks on braces, you need to see your ortho that day. Its not ideal.(I\\'m OP) Thanks much--but what are the \"online uploads\" you do?  Photos? Something else?Yes you upload them online and theyre viewed by an ortho.

(i.e., are new retainers covered under the comprehensive plan)?It depends on your contract. Mine I paid to include them, it was a slight up charge at my ortho. However, after traditional braces I didnt have it and paid $500 each time. Id highly recommend asking and seeing if they will let you add it if it doesnt come included, it easily pays for itselfI was given 4 sets of retainers when I was finished. Its been about 15 months and I still am using my first setI only had to replace mine every few years, it is recommended as you dont always notice them stretching out. Mine I mostly broke before 3 years hit, but I also didnt get these cause of not wearing my retainers but rather to finish what I never did with my braces. My teeth never shifted in the 12 years between!Ok. Good to know. Thank youHi all.\\nI finished Invisalign last year Aug. 2021. So Ive been Invisalign-free for nine months now and Im still happy with the results. This is just a friendly reminder to everyone that even after Invisalign or braces, please remember to wear your night-time retainers. Dont let all that time and money go to waste for a temporary smile. Retainers really are a life long commitment.Congratulations! And what a beautiful smile!Thank you so much!Retainers are a life long commitment. \\nDoes it mean you have to wear the retainer forever ?It does, or until you want your teeth to move back. First 20-22 hours a day (my ortho says for a year but Ive seen others being recommended less) so the teeth can set in their new place, then night time wear for the rest of your life.I dont mind this. Invis helped cut down nighttime snacking to zero for me and Ive lost 15 lbs without working out cause of that. If nighttime retainers help keep my teeth straight and extra pounds off, count me in lmaoThis is what Im looking forward to.  I get my aligners in two weeks my horrible habit is the godawful late night snacks!  So if it can help me cut that down Im all for it lol.  I have no self controlWow, I thought you are done when you are doneAbsolutely not. Half the stories in here are people who had braces as a kid and didn\\'t wear their retainer after.Correct. I had braces and wore my retainer for years, but then as an adult just kind of trailed off and stopped. That\\'s why I\\'m now having to do Invisalign to repair the shifting my teeth have done back to where they were prior to my braces. Moral of the story: Always wear your retainer.\\n\\nThe good news for me is that I need a night guard for grinding, and the retainer will do double-duty, so I\\'m happy with it.Hi, we are twins. Orthodontic twins, at least. Same exact story here and I plan to wear my retainers in lieu of my night guardforever!No, even the Invisalign site itself tells you you\\'ll have to wear a retainer or your teeth will revert back to their original state. In fact, go to the Invisalign site and look at the section where it discusses \"Retainers\". It gives you the specific schedule you can expect to have to wear your retainer. It\\'s very helpful.Thats the dream Same for regular braces too of thats any consolation.Right? I am so surprised to read that I have to wear the same damn thing for the rest of my life...Mine says my last liner is 6 weeks. I dont know about my retainer yet.Does anyone know what Invisalign retainers are made from? It was a concern when I started that having plastic in my mouth could not be good for my health. Now realizing it will be a life long thing, Im wondering if this could have health effects?Basically. My ortho told me that no matter how much time has passed, your teeth naturally wants to go back to its original state.Yeah because teeth are just bones in a bit of flesh that are in that position because of the forces of your bite. Teeth will never go in exactly the same position, but they\\'ll go in approximately the same position because all the forces that made them go into that position are still there. But for example after a jaw surgery teeth might naturally move into different positions.Great post! I wanted to ask how it\\'s been post treatment.    \\nHow compliant were you during treatment?    \\nHow compliant are you post treatment ie are you wearing them every single night or have you skipped or anything else?     \\nHave your teeth moved since you stoped wearing aligners and are now on nightly.Hi. For the first week or so it felt weird to not have my aligners on during the day since treatment. I wore my retainers every night recommended by my ortho and I havent missed a night since. I also havent noticed any shift in my teeth.Make sure to get your retainer replaced if it has cracks!!! I just went back to my final last tray (from December) only to find out my teeth shifted. Retainers  dont retain when they have cracks.Yes, absolutely!how long did it last you?It lasted me about 5 months. All the time wear. Maybe I wasnt careful enough taking them out? I think mine also had an interesting fit on my back molars making it a bit difficult to get in and out. Im going to have them put in a lingual bar next week. Everyone in my family had insane bottom teeth crowding. I want to do what it takes to preserve this. I love straight so much! Easier to clean and bite feels so healthy.yeah ive wondered how long to expect them to last when youre wearing the first one full time for so long. i feel you about the bottom teeth crowding - my bottom 4 werent too pretty before but yes straight is SO nice and easier to clean!They last about a year or so.Why dont just put a permanent wire behind your teeth ? Im halfway through my Invisalign process and the wire is something that is included in my treatment, like a standard stepAlong with my night retainers, I do have permanent wires of my bottom 6 teeth. This was an additional option after my treatment. I dont have it behind my top teeth because when I bite down, my teeth are very close to one another, so most likely it would cause the retainer to come off.Now I\\'m nervous that maybe a wire is included in mine and I wasn\\'t told. Lol I very much do not want one, even though I would be a candidate due to crowding. I\\'m 100% fine with wearing my retainers forever. Lol I hope they don\\'t mind if I refuse.Usually the wire is optional, so you can refuse it if you dont want it. The night retainers are a a must though. Get you orthos feedback first based on your case. Also,  ask your ortho that if you do end up getting the wires, but dont end up liking it or find it to be a hassle, you can get it removed and just stick to night retainers.Awesome,  thanks!I\\'m curious.  Do the retainers help with teeth grinding or protect your teeth if you\\'re a teeth clencher or grinder at night?\\n\\nI\\'m mainly doing Invisalign due to TMJ and incorrect teeth alignment that affects my bite and jaw.Invisalign can help. But, you can request custom made night guards for your tmj if you don\\'t want to go through the Invisalign process at your dentist. \\n\\nPersonally, one of the main reason that I did Invisalign was to slightly alleviate the teeth grinding caused by my overbite and of course to have straighter teeth.. I still have TMJ but, it\\'s not as bad as before I did Invisalign. \\n\\nIn my orthodontist office, they had the option to make my plastic retainer thicker than normal ones to help with the grinding.That\\'s why I\\'m doing it.  The custom made night guard would only help with teeth grinding, not fix my bite or align my teeth properly.\\n\\nI\\'m at #7 of 48.  Not too bad so far.Beautiful smileHonestly after being on Invisalign for 3 years, Im so used to wearing them that I cant sleep without my retainers in lolIm ignoring my last (childhood) ortho doing things myself this time around and *gradually* decreasing the amount of time from 24/7 wear to nights only.

Im in this predicament because I didnt where my retainers after braces. But my buddy ended up with a wire, 22 years later his teeth are still perfect and Im back in orthodontics. Round 2 as an adult is a munch more serious undertaking for my especially because of the money , so he can either bond a wire in or Im telling him to kick rocks and finding someone who will.I have permanent wires to cover all front teeth, top and bottom. I do wear my night retainer 99% of the time, but it\\'s nice to know my teeth won\\'t shift that much when I forget the other 1% of the time.Oh wow. The wire retainers should have been an option for you and definitely covered! ”I have permanent retainers along with night retainers and I didnt have to pay extra for either one at the end of my treatment because it was covered. The permanent retainers are only on my bottom 6 teeth and this was an option for me because my ortho told me that flossing might be a little annoying.Damn, my ortho had to take off my permanent bottom wire that I had since I was in middle school (17 years? And I was lucky that it never popped out). I wish I had one on my top front teeth because thats the ones that shifted that Im trying to fix now ;/The wire alone isnt enough since it only covers a few teeth. Wire + plastic retainer combo is good for preventing relapse.Wire alone is more than enough of its installed from first molar to first molar.Interesting. Ive never heard of a wire that extends from molar to molar. Usually just the middle few.After braces, my husband has a wire on some of his teeth - and was recommended braces, not invisilign, braces.Can you get a permanent retainer (metal attachment behind teeth) and a clear retainer at the same time or is it one or the other?You can get both. And the clear retainer is especially necessary if the wire does not span across all your teeth.amazing teeth! were you told to only wear them at night?

You never know 20 years from now if ur teeth start shifting and cause u pain. I think better be safe than sorry. \\n\\nAnd if they say u don\\'t really need both (but u wanna do both) ADVOCATE FOR IT ANYWAY.Yea good idea personally i dont mind night time retainers ive gotten used to this with invisalign anyway so theres no issue with me continuing until the day i dieI do get itmust wear retainer. I had braces as a teen, gave up the retainer after 5 years or so and teeth slowly shifted. Fast forward another 5 years and theres be no way the retainer would have kept my teeth where they were, looking at the retainer my teeth have changed shape, as in grew. Potentially my teeth werent ready for braces as a teen. Something as a parent I will be thinking about. Teeth arent fully in the position they will be as an adult when youre a teen. Im glad though. I wouldnt want my teeth to stayed looking like my teen teeth - the teeth and arch are tiny and look like a child.  My kids will need braces but Im expecting Ill put them in braces and set their expeditions that they will likely get them aligned again as an adult.I understand. I started Invisalign in my mid 20s and even though I thought I was late in the game, my ortho reminded me that I have adult teeth and they were all in position compared to teen teeth.On day 3 of 1 out of 19 trays.

I was honestly ready to go with it after my consultation but retainer situation personally for me was a huge dealYour teeth look beautiful. I had my treatment 5 years ago.

I had them almost 3 years as a kid and don\\'t remember them being awful. I was getting to the point where I was getting angry and justifying wearing my trays for only a few hours a day. I was screwing myself in the long run!I just hated the whole process of Invisalign. I hated how much room for user error there was. I wasn\\'t being compliant enough, admittedly. This way, I don\\'t have the ability to slack. Probably have about 7 months of braces to goI have thought about it many times myself. You will need to do a very good job of cleaning tbough, that doesn\\'t changeWhen you say not being complaint do you mean, not wearing them 22 hours a day? \\n\\nIm 2 weeks in, its been a massive adjustment and Im taking my trays out around 8 times a day, Im getting worried this will hurt my progress even though I am wearing them 22 hours a day still. I know regular braces can be very painful, and have their own issues, but I guess this post gives me peace of mind that the opportunity to switch is there \\nIts hard to see myself doing this for 10+ months lol\\nAt my Orthodontist he offers Invisaligns for the same price as regular so I imagine IF I wanted to switch it wouldnt be a big dealYes please elaborate. My ortho said the only time he had people stop were smokers who didnt like brushing their teeth ten times a dayI cant speak for the poster, but I went out for dinner last night and holy crap, it was incredibly stressful. I feel like each day requires extra thought and planning, and Ive been doing well with it, but it gives me anxiety thinking of doing this for the long haul. Thats my issue anyway. My life is pretty chaotic, and spur of the moment, as is everyones I think - for me I think I just need to give it more time and fall into more of a routine. Realize if I have one day where I extend my time by even a few minutes the world wont come crashing down on me. \\nIll say this though, brushing my teeth 10 times a day if I had to wouldnt bother me if I could do what I wanted, so I cant see anyone quitting Invisaligns for just that reason alone.This is something people have to take into consideration. I\\'m a regimented person by nature. I love schedules. I\\'m the \"greater good,\" individual so nothing people have told me about invisalign bothers me. I don\\'t even think \"damn I\\'ll have to go the bathroom to take them out.\" It doesn\\'t even cross my mind.Yeah its really not that hard most of the time. I put together a little dental kit with a toothbrush, small toothpaste, floss, soap; its in a little pouch and I keep it in my bag for whenever I go out. When you are compliant and only popping them out for shorter periods (like an hour or less most of the time), they come out quickly and painlessly. At dinners, Ive either turned away and discreetly popped them out of my mouth (nobody else at the table noticed) or if I cant be discreet or its a nicer restaurant Ill go to the bathroom and do it. If I dont have time to go to the bathroom and flood and clean everything before I leave, I will quick brush my teeth in the street and pop my aligners back in until Im somewhere less public again. If I have a water bottle Ive even gone off to a quiet corner and quickly cleaned everything on the go. I know other people who carry aligner/denture cleaning foam that they spray in their aligners while theyre eating and then they pop them in when theyre done eating. \\n\\nIts barely more effort than washing your hands before and after meals, you just need to build a habit and set yourself up for success. Popping out both of my aligners, drizzling them with Castile soap, quick brushing them out takes 10-20 seconds; if I have a water bottle and the little on-the-go dental pouch I put together, I can do this anywhere and any time. A really quick floss takes takes like 20-30 seconds. Brushing your teeth takes another minute or two. If you cant brush your teeth, swish with water, pop a little toothpaste in your mouth for the mouthwash effect, and pop your aligners in until you get somewhere where its easier to clean them. Having to spend up to 3 minutes on having having good hygiene after eating shouldnt feel difficult, and it feels a lot better/easier for me to be able to take off my aligners when I need/want to than it is to feel self-conscious about having braces (and everyone I know who has had braces has had a longer treatment plan than my Invisalign plan). \\n\\nAlso 8x per day is a LOT of times to be eating during the day. Cut out the sugary drinks, drink plain or sparkling water, and have 2-4 meals a day. If youre really busy, think of healthy, satisfying snacks you can have on the go that are unlikely to get stuck in teeth, like a smoothie. And when you want to eat, think about it youre eating out of habit out because you actually want to be ” maybe this means you dont buy junk food at the movies, or you stick to clear cocktails during happy hour and skip having appetizers. Yes there can be some friction to first adopting new habits, but ultimately all of the habits that you need to be doing to be successful on Invisalign are healthy and good for you. Its baffling to me that people would rather pay twice as much money to force themselves out of having the choice to exercise discipline and build habits that collectively maybe take 20 mins out of your day. Shrug.Wow this is super excessive and probably damaging to your enamel. You really shouldn\\'t brush that quickly after eating/drinking. If you brush less than 30 mins-1 hour after you are actually brushing away your enamel. This is because the bacteria in your mouth turn the sugars in your food/drinks into acid which softens the enamel. This process is generally nullified by your saliva after eating. You can also nullify by swishing water around your mouth to raise the pH back up and rinse away the food. But it takes a while for your enamel to reharden.\\n\\nJust pop them out to eat, swish with water after eating, pop them back in, then brush a couple hours later when you get home.Thats only if youre eating acidic foods to give your teeth time to recover from an erosive attack (the studies on this typically use soda, which has an extremely acidic pH), and you can typically counteract this by raising the pH in your mouth (which you can easily do by swishing plain water). What youre suggesting is actually much worse, because you are trapping all that food residue against your teeth without any saliva flow to keep bacteria growth down, and by leaving it that way for hours you give the bacteria plenty of time to breed uninhibited and eat at your enamel. I use a very soft toothbrush and my toothpaste is SLS-free and contains nHAP. Hygienist literally complimented me on how great my teeth looked at my last cleaning. Do some real research.For sure, for me I was thinking 2 hours a day, thats plenty of time. Realistically it is.\\nIts a lifestyle change, and I didnt realize it until I was in it. I think for those who dont love schedules and planning, its a wake up call but you can adjust, \\n\\nIm glad this isnt a struggle for you though! I need this discipline and outlook. \\nI hope in time I will get it!Yes! I just started mine last Friday and Ive said too its a lifestyle change that you dont even realize until its too late. Im admittedly a stoner so I get the munchies lol and its too much of a hassle to get up and take the aligners out just to have a snack or drink anything other than water. Even having morning coffee is a chore now. Plus they hurt like hell. Someone told me it gets better but damn \\xadSo, the tea in the morning gets me every time still. I have to wait for it to cool off or burn my mouth, and I used to love to sip on it over the course of 30-45 mins while reading and now its like you aint got time for this shit! ‚\\n\\nI have to imagine it gets easier. But youre right things do feel like a chore! \\nI know for some people its easy, everyone has their own opinion and their own story lolUgh, yes. Ive found myself practically chugging my iced coffee now Can you elaborate on this? You have to take them out and brush every time you eat or drink something not water?Thats right, you cant eat food with them in, or drink anything but water. So each time they come out youre brushing your teeth before putting them back in.Fair enough, thanks for the perspectiveNp! Im not giving by any means, I deal with anxiety (not using it as an excuse) and knowing its a possibility to switch eases my mind, instead of thinking I will mess this up, I will mess this up, what if I cant do this for x amount of time. \\nI think everyone is different though, some people its easier, some its more challenging.Yes! A routine is great. And itll form a habit by being consistent and you wont even notice it bothering you anymore. My ortho said accountability is a big thing for any ortho treatment. But itll be done before you know it!!I like to eat and I don\\'t like having to center my love of food around the need to clean my teeth all the time. Especially in bed at night when I like to have hot tea and some crappy snack (pop tarts or something. Don\\'t judge me) and hated having to get up and clean my teeth after. Not a healthy lifestyle whatsoever i know but it\\'s how I am unfortunatelyJust to play Internet mom for a moment, if you eat pop tarts in bed, PLEASE brush your teeth after regardless. \\n\\nWith braces, its really really easy for food to stick around and linger under your attachments and wires and so its even MORE important to have good oral hygiene now that itll be so much harder to clean. \\n\\nPlease dont think that braces mean you can be less diligent with your brushing and flossing ” it actually means you must be even more diligent. Otherwise you risk cavities/discoloration on the front of your teeth, which is really not good!Thank you so much for playing mom though. My food issues are something I truly hate about myself and I have so much shame around it. I know how unhealthy it is and the teeth thing just adds more guilt around it. I very much appreciate your caring °This is low key so gangsta I love it ‚Aww, please dont hate anything about yourself. You are a special and unique person and nothing about ourselves is written in stone.\\n\\nWere all doing the best we can, one day at a time. Brush tonight! Youll feel better :)Thank you. I\\'m in therapy and it helps a ton. Just have to figure out how to get better about food \\n\\nLuckily I\\'m out of poptarts and yogurt, which are my go tos before bed.I feel you. I sometimes have to force myself to throw something in the trash to prevent myself from finishing the whole bag/tray/etc. Or just not even having something because once I get a taste I cant stop. “ Hang in there!Oh yes I know that. That\\'s the thing, I do know all of this. But in the moment, I don\\'t care. I hate that I\\'m like that. My food addiction issues are something my therapist and I talk about a lot. I\\'m so unhealthy with food, and it\\'s not gotten better since starting the orthodontic process. I\\'m hoping to be more diligent with braces but when I\\'m \"in the zone\" with food, I\\'m a different person and I hate myself in the morning.FWIW, I did 38 trays (24 initial trays, then a second round of 14 that wasnt technically refinements because I had a medical issue in between that rendered me unable to wear them for two weeks, so my teeth shifted) after which neither my orthodontist nor I were satisfied with my bottom teeth. \\n\\nIm now in a Vivera on top and braces on the bottom, because he told me that he thinks Ill get a better result from that than from doing more trays. My top teeth arent perfectly straight either ” one of my front teeth is pushed very slightly outward because of how my bottom teeth currently hit ” so once we get the bottom teeth wrangled Im going to have to get rescanned and do a couple more trays on top. The retainer is just holding them in place for now until were ready to do the finishing tweaks. \\n\\nIt all seems very complicated.Wearing them like maybe 18 hours a day, not cleaning my teeth properly, not doing the chewies. Just too much room for slackingOh okay, it makes sense. It wasnt working for you and you changed it. Im glad youre still keeping with something because your progress is great so far! \\nIts funny I keep reading about chewies but my ortho hasnt mentioned it to me..I hated the chewies, hated the requirement for constant cleaning, the in and out of the trays if I wanted to do anything. \\n\\nHonestly though I was waiting till I did a marathon recently because I wanted to see how I did with fueling during the run. I had my case and my ortho key and I\\'d remove tgem and put them back in as needed. But when you\\'re needing to eat every 5 or so miles (at least that\\'s how I do), it\\'s annoying with the in and out. So that was my decision maker. I\\'d been thinking about it and going back and forth but the marathon sealed it. I had a hard race day and took almost 6 hours to complete the race (long for me) and the in and out just pissed me off and I ended up leaving them out for the last 8 miles or so. No reason to leave them out other than I was annoyed. But also when you\\'re eating sugary gels, pretzel sticks, baas, etc, you also can\\'t clean your teeth while running. So I eventually said F it and decided I\\'d call my ortho after I got backWoah, that does sound like a massive pain in the ass. Especially with marathons, training etc. \\nSounds like you made the right call for yourself. Now you can just go about each day!And definitely snack more. I like snacking. Now I can do it again without guilt hahaYES the guilt. Why do I feel guilty for taking my trays out more often than others even if Im sticking with only 2 hours per day without them in? \\nThis is why I have issues, this is my brain. Im following the 22 hour a day rule but this voice in my head is like nooooo, youre taking them out too much, every 2-3 hours is not acceptable!  \\n\\nIll add, sitting down to watch a movie and having a bowl of chips out or trail mix to graze on throughout? I do miss this, but my spouse said œJust think of it like going to the theatre, you finish your popcorn before the movie even starts\\x9d - some wise words. ‚Haha!! Yes that\\'s very true!I did a couple ultras over the summer on shorter loop courses, I took them out and brushed as needed. I raced a marathon recently. I carried 2 fruit smoothie pouches and just tried to swallow past the Invisalign which was effective enough. The aligners get a little messy but just brush and clean them as soon as possible.I\\'m really good about swishing with water and carrying mouthwash on me but definitely not good about the brushing except morning and evening. Sometimes I\\'ll get wild and brush midday or right before bed but it\\'s rare. I don\\'t want to lose my teeth so I know I definitely need to take better care of themI\\'m sorry but I really don\\'t understand how the cleaning and eating requirements are any easier with traditional braces. Cleaning around the wires is awful and you have to reduce your diet a lot due to how easy it is to accidentally brake a bracket.I had this issue to. Especially with wearing my eslatics. So my ortho suggested to start with 18 hours a day.. majority of that time is night time anyways then progress to 19 hours; then 20 and so on. It gets easier once you get use to it. Im a huge snacker and take mine out so many times per day. Some days I only wear them 12. I try not to be so hard on myself and think tomorrows a new day and I can try again to wear them longer the next day. Definitely an adjustment. I did start out with braces (also wore them for a year when I was 15) then 28 I decided to get braces but they wanted me to swear a permanent spring (cause I just couldnt deal with the elastics and changing them cause Im a snacker lol  there was nooo way I could do that (imagine having one of those trampoline springs in your mouth 24/7 that you cant remove) so I told them to switch to Invisalign. Ive had so many issues with Invisalign not making the trays proper on certain weeks so Ive had to get rescanned 3 times. Hopefully third times a charm! If not, Im going to say screw it and have braces for the remaining 6 months and just push through it. If I kept my braces on and dealt with the spring I wouldve already been done treatment but oh well everything happens for a reason.You can try doing what I did, keep them on for coffee - they got my stains out before next set of refinements. And eat less times a day. I ate 1-2 times bc I also wanted to lose some weight. It really is doable. You just need the right mindset. I avoided getting braces after seeing a friend wearing them for 2 years and spending 30 minutes in the bathroom after each meal, trying to get the food out of the braces. So I said no way!love the orange! picking colors is definitely the best part of braces (aside from getting them off lol)Yep! I had braces from 10 to 13 and always did holiday colors (orange and black for Halloween, orange and brown for Thanksgiving, red and green for Christmas etc).. I\\'m 39 soon and DGAF about how it looks. Orange is my favorite color and I\\'m owning it. My husband is already teasing meYou may as well have fun :)I feel like this sub takes things to the extreme unnecessarily. I probably average 22 hours a day, but there are some days where I maybe only get 20 because Im sipping on a soda for a couple hours to get through a sleepy afternoon. I dont brush after eating everything, actually never after lunch, usually just rinse with some water and then pop the retainers back in. I snack late at night and sometimes am too lazy to brush before bed. I didnt change anything about my oral hygiene since getting Invisalign and am nearly halfway, just completed a dental and Ortho checkup and everything is going great, no cavities or problem areas and tracking right where they should be. ITS NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL. Yeah, the goal is to brush after eating anything and get 22 hours in a day, but if you dont, youre not going to die or have shitty teeth for the rest of your life.\\n\\nUnless you know you have pre-existing conditions which will require higher maintece, just do your best, dont lose any sleep, and live your life.\\n\\nAlso wanted to note, I had braces as a teenager and Invisalign is 1000x better. I would starve for 3 days after tightening because I couldnt eat, where now I only have about 5-6 hours of discomfort late in the tray change day.I\\'m usually a big rule follower but just couldn\\'t with this. Even with some understandable slacking, I was still slacking way too much for it to be worth it. I was really only setting myself up for failureWell put. Im in tray 14 of 32 and have seen significant progress without focusing too much on the 22 hours a day rule. Lots of people on here even have had success with only 14-16 hours wear a day. Like you said, it really is not that big of a deal.I average 20 hours a day and am doing fine. I think as long as you hit 20 you should be ok, atleast according to my ortho. Im sorry but 22 hours is impossible to do and I cant afford not to eat food just for another 2 hours of wear time.I had to do the same thing after a year and a half into Invisalign. They just werent movingI kept doing progress pics and not noticing a difference but I still was wearing them maybe 16 to 18 hours a day most of the time. I know I was messing up. \\n\\nHow was your braces experience after switching?Freaking hated it but it worked! Fast!Here\\'s my update! They moved fast! \\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/qioasx/update_after_8_days_of_braces_switched_from/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareDid you have to pay for both?Most orthos include the cost of braces, if needed. Like mine said if my teeth are too stubborn to move after eventual refinements, we can always put braces on to make everything perfect.Thank you!No but I was kind of mad that some of my Invisalign money wasnt refunded. I paid over 5 grand to straighten my teeth with Invisaligd I ended up in metal braces for 6 months.What issues were you trying to correct?How much this cost you to switchNothing. It was included at my orthodontist officeFor real? How you pay?My insurance covered some when I first got invisalign and then I paid about $2500. It wasn\\'t until my follow-up appointment 3 months after that I said how much I hated it all. The tech told me they include a 1 time change to braces in what I paid. I kept thinking about it and tried to make myself get my act together with invisalign and be more compliant but it just wasn\\'t happening. I was slacking too much, which would be both a waste of money and would also prolong the process. I was my own worst enemy about it so this is my \"punishment\" for lack of a better wordIm glad you recognized your issue and arent just giving up on braces entirely! I would hate to waste that money.WHAT. I am really struggling to choose between two Invisalign or lingual and Im really hoping that theyll offer something like this when I go in for my next consult! Is this common?!Lingual are some of the hardest to maintain due to how hard they are to clean since you can\\'t see them. I would personally never do them.Update! \\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/qioasx/update_after_8_days_of_braces_switched_from/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=shareI\\'m not sure. I went for my 12 week follow-up and all I did was mention how I hated it and she suggested it as a free option. I didn\\'t know about it when I first got them thoughI wouldve got traditional braces for the price alone but Im moving countries and thought Invisalign was best, sometimes I am sick of them though and hope its worth it because Ill have them for a year and only halfway through …My friend got her invisalign a month before I did so it\\'s been nice having someone to go through it with. She hates it too but she\\'s staying committed. She\\'s better than me hahaI know Im in the minority but after two months of Invisalign its not any easier. I absolutely hate it. I hate the room for user error too, and any time I submit a cinder to my ortho its œuse chewies more\\x9d which chewies make me gag sorry. I know a lot of people say after a few eels they dont even notice their trays. But Im hyper aware because they tear my cheeks up all day. I also snack a lot and have weak enamel so Im constantly stressing over not brushing enough and brushing too much. Anyway good on you for making a choice that works. My treat should be over in 3.5 months IF Im tracking but who knows. I still hate itI get why youve done it. If I didnt have to pay extra I would do the same.Can you tell me why?Commented on the other question with my personal experience of why.I wanna know why, I just started InvisalignFor my personal journey:\\n\\nIts been a mentally draining nightmare to constantly have to monitor when I eat, time myself and clean and put trays back in three times minimum a day. I feel so controlled by it. I find the 22 hour wear time aim impossible and unrealistic for life. Im sick of just drinking water in between mealtimes. I hate the attachments on almost every tooth and had so much IPR that I dont see how they can ever safely do anymore.\\n\\nAnd worst of all by my œfinal\\x9d tray I havent had the results I was expecting after 10+ months of sticking to all the rules. Lateral incisor still stuck behind my front tooth and wonky midline.\\n\\nPaid a fortune and this has just made me really grumpy. Im waiting for a scan and refinements for who knows how long, cant really go back now as switching to braces isnt something I can afford. I just want this to end now and wish Id had a quote for braces as well as this but I was worried about the appearance. Now I couldnt care less about how it would have looked and would have just got funky pink ones.\\n\\nI am now pregt and at this rate Ill be giving birth before this is over, something I never imagined would happen. So Im going to be stuck in plastic with a newborn too. \\n\\nLike I said. Personal experience for me, lots of people swear by this and love it. I dont.I wish I couldve. I went through a dentist. Dont be meCan you share more about your experience?I have a pretty severe overbite and my two front teeth are crowded (sort of like how Miley cyruss front teeth used to be), my bottom teeth are straight. I was told before by an orthodontist (right after high school, around 2013)  that my overbite is too severe to be corrected by anything but jaw surgery, which i cant afford, and that I wasnt a good candidate for invisalign. In 2020 I went to a dentist who seemed really good at the time and they offered invisalign, said Id be a great candidate for it. I finally had an insurance plan that put money towards orthodontics so I thought hey, why not go for it. \\n\\nThe process was not communicated well to me at all and by the end after a couple refinements she told me my teeth will never look straight unless I get crowns for my front two teeth, with a quote of 3,000 dollars. I was 25 at this time- filing down my healthy teeth to put crowns on them is an insane idea. \\n\\nI dont believe I was actually a good candidate for invisalign. I think she just wanted money. I feel like if I had been given the chance to switch to braces for better results when my teeth were being stubborn (and I was admittedly getting burnt out on the process) I wouldve taken it in a heartbeat. Instead, I spent 6000 dollars (4K after insurance) and am still not happy with my teeth.\\n\\nI plan to get ceramic braces at some point in the future and I hope to actually be happy with my teeth someday.Thank you for sharing your story! Im sorry that that happened to you. I also have an overbite and am debating between Invisalign or braces. I been told Invisalign will take considerably longer to correct my teeth, because they are rather complicated. I am a little skeptical of whether Invisalign will provide the same results. Good luck with any future treatments!Youve got to do what works for you for the results you want. I am super impressed you didnt have to pay any extra!I actually loved Invisalign. I did research before  and I concluded it will be a good time to also lose some baby weight so I trained myself to eat 1-2 times a day to avoid the headaches of taking it out more. So this is what I did. I lost 18 pounds in 4 months, my teeth look great ( waiting on refinements still) and I know that the system I put in place works for me. I did drink coffee and smoked with it on, though. No problems so far. I only cheated 2 times , at a wedding and at another party but I added an extra day of wearing. I did wear them even more than 22 hr a day for 99% of the time. What can I say, I really wanted to get things right. So I think it s doable.  Best of luck!Smoked cigarettes?Yes :DCan you share what your day to day system or routines was like? Thanks!Sure!  Woke up, rinsed with mouthwash without taking it out, had my coffee/ciggarettes , took the aligner out to have my first meal between 11am-2pm, cleaned my teeth and the trays and put it back on. Rinse again before bed. \\nI sometimes ate twice a day, cleansing teeth and aligner after each of those meals. , but since I keep a pair of trays for 7 days, 4 of these days are more painful so I only have another 3 to take it off and eat without pain. So I kinda keep the routine for all the 7 days.What happened to cause the switch?Just too much user error, and I\\'m the user. I wasn\\'t being compliant enough for my tastes and knew I was messing up my progress by slacking. This way it\\'s more controlled and keeps me on scheduleHow come you made the switch? Your choice or orthos recommendation?I just hated the whole process of Invisalign. I hated how much room for user error there was. I wasn\\'t being compliant enough, admittedly. This way, I don\\'t have the ability to slack. Probably have about 7 months of braces to go[removed]Youre rude ºï¸\\x8fYou\\'re a jerk. If it works for OP, why does it matter?

And I'm glad I can take them out for a good cleaning.I agree! I was very hesitant to start Invisalign, but once I did, I was surprised at how easy and convenient it was.For me traditional braces is nightmare, I had 3 orthodontic treatments using traditional braces, actually first one was successful, then the relapse and open bite occurred due to wisdom teeth growth, did the braces again twice and they both worsen the situation even more. It was due to brackets not aligned properly that caused the entire mid line to shift + cross bite development.. + and even he didnt insert the wire properly on damon brackets that caused extrusion of my incisor, what I wanted to say is Invisalign is more accurate and u dont have to worry about doctors mistakes + u do also see the actual result and it is worth it.

Invisalign or Metal?While a boob lift or tummy tuck seems more in line at my age, unfortunately some teeth have shifted and at this stage of the game I now need braces. My dentist recommends Invisalign but from what I have read it seems like a lot of work and discipline and not a 100% guaranteed result as opposed to metal braces which are in place and seem to offer a better possible result. I get the whole aesthetic thing and Im not thrilled about that but Im not confident in having to deal with work that Invisalign seems to require. I have a busy law practice and I don\\'t want to deal with something that\\'s going to consume a lot of time and energy but maybe Im wrong. Would love to get some feedback on regular braces vs. Invisalign - Thanks!!If you have a busy lifestyle and cant deal with having to take them in and out to eat and brush your teeth throughout the day, Id say go for traditional braces. I initially wanted braces because I didnt like that the results would be in my hands with Invisalign. However I opted for Invisalign because I really wasnt stoked with the look of braces and I am getting married soon and didnt want braces for my wedding. I am SO glad I opted for Invisalign. I work from home so it really hasnt been an issue at all and honestly even if I worked in office it still wouldnt be that bad. You just have to be very aware and diligent. People have amazing results with Invisalign and braces. The only difference is that with Invisalign the results are mostly based on the patients compliance.They aren\\'t a lot of work/discipline for an adult who has spent any sort of time, y\\'know, adulting. I spend maybe 5 minutes a day dealing with my Invisalign more than my general dental hygiene. I can eat with them in other than super crunchy stuff and just do a quick brush/rinse after, which you should do anyway even without any teeth correctors. I keep a small Tupperware with hydrogen peroxide in it on my desk for soaking my trays while I brush. If you end up switching trays weekly you won\\'t have enough time per tray for them to accumulate a lot of staining from coffee so you can still sip relaxedly rather than having to gulp it down to get your wear time.\\n\\nWhen I had regular braces as a teenager, flossing was hell between the brackets but with Invisalign it\\'s just as easy as plain teeth. And you don\\'t have to floss after every meal.\\n\\nFor perspective, I\\'m 42 and work full time, take an online accounting class, volunteer, run my household, work out, and have a great social life; Invisalign has never interfered with any of that busy schedule.\\n\\nYour first couple days will be hell but braces will be just as uncomfortable, so just plan to get them \"installed\"--whichever option--before a weekend.Wow, I\\'ve never had anything other than water with my trays in. I\\'m so anal about it. I didn\\'t know you could eat with them in.As I expected, you now have opinions from both sides of the fence.  A couple of clarifications:\\n\\n* With fixed braces you still must brush after eating anything, or risk decay (or looking silly!).\\n* With fixed braces you can\\'t safely eat hard or sticky foods.\\n* There is a greater risk of gum problems with fixed braces, because they are harder to clean.\\n* The pain/discomfort from Invisalign is ~1/10th that of fixed braces, according to most who have had both.\\n* With Invisalign you can see the predicted finish of your teeth before you start.\\n* With Invisalign there are no real emergencies, like broken brackets or wires.  It\\'s usually just a lost/broken aligner, and you move on to the next.\\n* Etc!\\n\\nYou may guess that I am rather biased, but that is based on many years of experience with both.I\\'m past the 2 year mark with invisalign at this point. I get your concerns about how rigid it may seem but honestly if you have a bathroom  you\\'d be okay with brushing your teeth at work, you\\'ll be fine. That being said I got to a point where I wouldn\\'t take them out if im having a cold beverage or something soft enough to chew on... \\n\\nI personally love being able to take these trays out rather than limit what food options I have. I also really liked only having to go in every few months compared to how often you\\'d be seeing your ortho with braces. \\n\\nMy sister had braces growing up and it fixed her teeth but she had a bad habit of not wearing her retainer and now her teeth are  spacing out again. Honestly, the end result just depends on how well you follow your ortho\\'s direction with either option you go with.Also depending on the time lol I had a private bathroom at work when I started and then they moved my office so now I\\'m in a shared, school type bathroom. My coworkers keep catching me brushing and probably think I\\'m a freakI like being able to eat whatever I want, and I like being able to take my trays out for a bit of a break. I also like that flossing is easier with trays. \\n\\nIf you think you lack discipline, braces might the better option for you. You do have to brush more frequently with Invisalign and the onus is on you to put trays in 20-22 hrs/day.\\n\\nIts not a one-size-fits all choice. You definitely have to weigh the pros and cons and figure out whats best for you.You also have the option of lingual braces if youre worried about the aesthetic of regular braces but dont wanna deal with the work that Invisalign comes with. Lingual braces go on the back of your teeth. \\n\\nHowever braces, lingual or regular comes with a lot of cons too. They tend to break way more often and even if you feel like you have the possibility to slack off a bit more you really need to be diligent with cleaning. At least if you dont want to get cavities or bacteria causing bad breath. Food really tend to get stuck a lot on braces.\\n\\nHaving tried both braces and Invisalign I would say personally that I thought Invisalign was a better experience.Im in my 30s and doing a year of Invisalign, Im a little over a month in and can safely say it requires discipline. My Mom is in her 60s and was considering Invisalign but has changed her mind since I got mine. Im probably a little over the top and by the book with how I care for them since I have OCD. Im very by the book with them since its my second time trying them and I dont want to do this again. I only drink water with my trays in and remove them 4 times a for meals and a snack. I always brush/floss my teeth and scrub my trays before reinserting as I do not want to risk cavities. My orthodontist said it was fine to just swish with water or mouthwash and rinse my trays with water after lunch/snacks/tea but Id rather be safe than sorry.\\n\\nEdit: I was given permission to eat celery and cucumbers with my trays in and drink clear alcohol and herbal tea as long as I swish eel with water after.It\\'s so hard for anyone to say because so rarely do you have both and can compare. To be fair, I\\'ve read of people quitting Invisalign for braces but not the other way around. That may be because Invisalign are a little like workout tapes vs the gym. One is much more convenient, but only if you have the discipline to make it work.\\n\\nIt makes it more of a personal decision although I would choose Invisalign again (five weeks in rn)', 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'financial concerns', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'oral hygiene', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'facial appearance', 'tray time management'], 'scores': [0.18013155460357666, 0.15206186473369598, 0.15059198439121246, 0.15056608617305756, 0.13629168272018433, 0.12542811036109924, 0.10492870956659317]}, {'sequence': \"Switching to braces for better mental health.

Constantly thinking about having to floss and brush after eating and wondering how much time theyve been out and that my teeth wont track if I dont put them back in ASAP. \\n\\nMaybe its because I like to eat small meals and snacks that its really fucking up my lifestyle and causing me unnecessary stress.

Its been 6 weeks/22 weeks so I feel Ive given it a good chance.[deleted]Having done both now, I dont think theyre worse because of the mouth sores. I got them with Invisalign attachments too and had to use peroxyl/hydrogen peroxide/sea salt mouth rinses for 2 weeks to heal all the cuts and sore on my cheeks and tongue.If youve done both and preferred the latter why are you hear ranting about your own mental health when your clearly the only one who can help you in YOUR predicament „Damn, who peed in your Invisalign this morning‚‚I had braces for 3 years... invisalign hands down! \\n\\nBraces cons: \\n\\n1. You cannot take them out ever - every picture you take for years will have you with braces. \\n\\n2. They are bulkier and more uncomfortable\\n\\n3. MOUTH SORES/PAIN/STABBING WIRES\\n\\n4. READ #3 ONE MORE TIME \\n\\n5. You have to be super careful what you eat or you will pop off a bracket \\n\\n6. You will without a doubt pop off a bracket and then have to make an extra appointment to get it fixed\\n\\n7. You have soooo many appointments\\n\\n8. You have to be much more diligent about cleaning because now you have all the wires to work around and you'll need a special tool to help you floss... \\n\\n9. You can get calcium deficiencies. My daughter has that... has super white spots all over her teeth where it's softer\\n\\nJust to name some...All very good points haha. I had braces for 4 years as a kid. I guess because Id only have about 4 months in braces after the 8 weeks in Invisalign is why I really dont care much. Even if it was a year, I wouldnt care at this point I feel. I cant stand not being able to eat whenever I want damnit lol. I made it through the holidays and my birthday as far as pictures goes. I popped off attachments and had them fuck them up again when I went to get them fixed. So Ive already had 3 appointments in 5 weeks. Lol. Im already on a soft diet right now because my teeth hurt so bad still. ¹ï¸\\x8fOh so you already know what you are in for... that's different! :) That's not a lot of time either. And good point on the attachments! Wish you the best of luck! When you say 4 months, 4 months is not bad at all!I would just pop them out, eat your meals/snacks, swish with water, and pop them back in when working. My ortho pushed for clear braces for me but I would have had metal lingual arches, spacers, rubber bands, etc. Been in Invisalign for 16 months now and none of that. The only inconvenience is taking them out, but throw on some hand sanitizer and keep the case in your pocket. And carry a bottle of water. When youre at home, its a little difference and you can brush after every meal, but just brush before your shifts and after and swish with water between snacking. I think people get stressed out when they think of obsessively cleaning their teeth. Like okay, theyll have the lowest risk for cavities, but swishing with water is effective too, especially if youre brushing before and after your shift.I mean each to there own OP, I get where you are coming from. I felt the exact same as you when I started, I think after time you find ways around them and get used to the timing issues. Im in the military so might have similar shift patterns to you on occasion and I get it can be an absolute nightmare. Ive had braces twice and Id take the Invisalign over that all day, not to tell you what to do as you sound like youve made your mind up but if you can, I really would suggest sticking it out for another month or so. You may find you get used to it and find alternative ways to deal with the issues youre having. If not best of luck with the clear braces!I think if I had a regular, 9-5, day shift job, and could always take an uninterrupted lunch, can always use the bathroom for a few minutes after a snack to brush and floss, without someone literally dying, I wouldnt hate Invisalign so much. Haha. \\n\\nGonna try for another few weeks. I think Im just stressed about a lot of other stuff in life, so this is just one more thing that I cant seem to handle. As silly as that sounds.Just came to say you're an ICU nurse during a pandemic - that's got to be feckin tough! You must be under serious pressure. You do you - honestly you know your own lifestyle and circumstances, maybe give it a few weeks to be sure. The braces route is slower but might be more in your control. I haven't got my invisalign yet lurking on the sub as I get them on in Feb! ¬I feel you! I've definitely thought about it myself since I got it.\\n\\nI feel like Dentists push Invisalign as the only option and neglect to really explain the lifestyle changes. \\n\\nClear braces aren't talked about enough as another option. I honestly didn't know anything about them until after Invisalign.\\n\\nDon't stress! People in this sub get a little too crazy. Your teeth are going to look amazing! ºï¸\\x8fI was suuuper against braces to begin with because I already had them for 4 years as a kid so I went in with the mentality of absolutely no braces. I am giving myself more grace with wearing them this week to see how it goes. Also, the movements I need (intrusion) are actually best made with braces so theres also that aspect. I mostly hate Invisalign at work and late at night when I do all my snacking lol. \\n\\nI think Ill give myself until my next appointment (9 weeks after starting) and if I hate it still, Ill have to switch.I think this is a silver lining of COVID. I am able to work from home. I think doing this in the office would be really challenging.Same. I'm not sure this would be going as well as it is if I actually needed to be in an office.Im the same and Im on maternity leave. The only problem is that I cant switch for free but if i could I would in a shot. This whole experience has been a major down point for me. I just havent got on with them and they majorly affect my moodsSame! I think it will cost me $250 to switch and thankfully Im in the position that it wouldnt be a problem but Im fucking over it lol. Theres no way I could have been pregt/on maternity leave doing this shit. I have issues with nausea at baseline (which is part of the reason I like small, frequent meals).I might ask for a price to switch. I just presume it would be more like thousands for me to switch. Id like to just switch to braces and get my life back. Ive been doing this for over a year now.I understand. January will be 8 months in Invisalign for me, and I get through it second by second. I hate it!! For several reasons. I feel that my ortho overpromised and under-informed, and that sucks. Its a lesson in patience, as obviously the results will be worth it, so Im hanging in there, meanwhile gaining mental strength through the process.. But I do have a friend who was inspired to start clear braces in November - so far he is not having a bad time, and I barely notice them on him. So who knows. You gotta do what your intuition says. Stick with it until you have your answer, and best of luck! Im just hoping Ill be released from tooth jail on time, and not have my sentence extended. Fingers are not crossed though.I initially had the carriere motion appliance because my original ortho tricked me into it and having to take out the lower retainer was a big pain. \\n\\nEventually I went to a consultation with a new orthodontist and ended up swapping out the carriere motion for braces since I decided the discreteness of Invisalign wasn't worth it and I'm really happy with my decision. I would say if you don't mind the aesthetics of braces it's definitely the better option convenience wise. Plus, with all the new variants we don't know how much longer masks will be aroundYou will regret 100%. Braces are bad you cant clean easily your teeth.Not true. Just get a Waterpik.Hey! Ugh, that sounds rough. Sorry to hear about your experience. What part of snacking is getting you down? I've been doing Invisalign for 8 months now and found some great tips that have gotten me through it. What are you most in need of advice on?I just hate that I cant just eat a quick cookie or protein bar or whatever without it being a whole process. I guess I could just floss and rinse afterwards but that doesnt negate that Im still having to do SOMETHING. I truly didnt think Id struggle with it this much.Ah, I see. Have you tried adding the cookie or protein bar as part of a main meal? \\n\\nFor instance, I do 3 large meals throughout the day. Still keeps me full and allows me to get the right intake of fiber + protein. So putting a cookie/bar out at the same time with your main dish could be a helpful solution. \\n\\nPerhaps the treat can be something to look forward to with your lunch or dinner -- much like a dessert. Feels odd at first, yet, like everything with clear aligners... you get used to it. Another alternative would be to have the snack to hold you over and do a quick rinse and floss until you find the time to brush.I had braces before I started with Invisalign and the pressure that I felt with braces was way worse that sometimes I couldn't just eat what I wanted, or eat at all, and that was for 2 years. \\nWith braces you are very restricted in what you can eat because and cleaning your teeth is more work. Plus your gum could suffer with inflamation too. \\nIf I am in a rush and I want to grab a snack, I will just floss real quick, listerine and put the trays back on.\", 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'oral hygiene', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'tray time management', 'facial appearance', 'financial concerns', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction'], 'scores': [0.20259571075439453, 0.1844293624162674, 0.14044031500816345, 0.12451311200857162, 0.12422781437635422, 0.12080320715904236, 0.10299044847488403]}, {'sequence': 'Did anyone need to switch to metal braces during their Invisalign treatment?I switched from metal to Invisalign.Im about to do the same, what are the biggest differences and which do you prefer?They both have pros and cons.

Good luck!!I'm feeling all of those things. Not sure I can go through with it.You got this!\\n\\nI'm in my first week too. Mainly I'm just skeptical and wondering if it will actually help. I only got mine because my dentist told me my teeth are wearing improperly because of a bad bite and that correcting my bite should also help my TMJ problems. I hope she's right. I just have no way of knowing until much further into this process.I also got Invisalign treatment to treat my TMJ. I would have been ok with traditional wire braces too, but the ortho said I would be good candidate for Invisalign so I trusted her. Im in week 8 (tray 8) and Im finally realizing I dont clench my teeth anymore and no longer wake up with shoulder pain. And my teeth are looking better and have a more balanced bite. Im liking it now. I only needed to wear these for 21 weeks total. Im almost halfway done. I think any longer I probably would have chosen wire braces .Id say hang in there if possible, on the last day of my first week before I switch and besides the first day of getting them I feel no discomfort.Trust me u wont even notice them soon lol my first thought was holy shit this is way worse than i thought It gets better! I've had mine over a year now and if I haven't eaten or drank in a while I forget they existFeeling all of these things but also that I have no choice because the attachments are already on my teeth and my smile looks really weird from the IPR.you seriously cant feel it at all after a few weeksIm on my way to get mine for the first time. Im nervous! Any tips for me?For me it was only bad for the first day after changing aligners every week, and honestly just change them at night time b4 u sleep will help a lotI've almost finished with mine, I'd say remember to floss daily, and get an extra couple of toothbrushes as well. Because you don't want to brush your teeth with the same one that you clean your tray with.Why not?I personally found that it makes your retainers smell a bit funky.This baffles me. Your trays go directly onto your teeth, anything you brush off your teeth will also be on the trays.\\n\\nMaybe you trays just smell funky after a while.\\n\\nI use a separate toothbrush because I am washing my trays in soap not toothpaste. It is also a toddler brush and fits in the tray better.\\n\\nTo each their own!First two days were the worst. Fortunately for me it wasnt that bad. My mouth was getting used to a foreign object so I was producing a lot of saliva which wasnt something I expected.Id say just try not to be too stressed, which is not very helpful advice but Im not sure how else to say it just takes a little time haha ‚. It feels overwhelming at first. I had a lot of trouble talking the first week but its gotten much better (in case you end up having that problem too but hopefully not).Get a water flosser (in addition to string). Accept that first week or so may well suck, first time taking them out is the worst by far.Ill say that this sub made me incredibly nervous about all of it and it turned out to be fine. For real - like its really pretty chill. No one cares. So many people are doing Invisalign now - its very normal.First couple of days are the worst in terms of pain. Change to new aligners before you go to bed so you sleep through most of the pain. Stick to 22 hours as often as possible but it's OK if you miss an hour here and there. Ramp up your tooth cleaning schedule to the max, it's so easy to do more damage to teeth and gums if you haven't properly cleaned after eating.\\n\\nEDIT - Also buy an outie tool, they're worth their price 10 times over.If you have to wear rubber bands, and can't see very well to hook them on, invest in a lighted, magnified makeup mirror.  Really helps a lot.I actually hooked my band onto the bottom tray before I put them in so when it was in all I'd need to do was hook them to my top teeth. I wear false nails and it's almost impossible to get bands in when the trays are already on.Nice!  I couldn't do that very well.  My nails suck and are weak.I actually started wearing false nails again because the trays break my real nails \\xad if I'm not wearing falsies I have to use a pick to get my trays off.Get tylenol 1sIm a little over a month in and I actually look forward to my weekly change because the progress is exciting to see!I feel like most of the people complaining about the first week or two are people who never got braces before. Invisalign may not feel like the nicest thing ever, but its miles better than how braces feel.Guilty! I never had braces. To be honest, 6 weeks in I am still struggling at times. But its not nearly as bad as the first two weeks. Im hoping it only gets better from here on.Youre doing great so far! Im sure itll get even better from here on out. It may be tough sometimes, but trust me when I say its insanely easier than braces (especially brushing and flossing). Plus you dont have to change your diet!Aww thank you! I keep telling myself it will only get better. And yeah im snacking all the things i want for sure lol. Im sure seeing results in a few weeks/months will help motivate a lot too.I had braces as a teenager and the spacers almost wrecked me. I had braces and a metal jaw aligner for two years. I just got Invisalign, and Im really moody from the feeling of wanting to bite down real hard and almost feeling claustrophobic in them. The glue/anchors or whatever is annoying me so much. I think my tolerance for unnecessary pain may be much lower now that Im older also. Im having a hard time justifying this right now. I will persevere because I remember braces getting easier, but right now the regret is real and I have a year and a half to go. \\n\\nI was not expecting the glue stuff on my teeth in the front. I feel hideous when I have to take them off. Since they have to put it on teeth, I wish it was only in the back. Just hoping this gets better soon.I feel you on allllll of this. I also had braces as a kid so I thought I was prepared for Invisalign but I got my first tray last week and boy was I not expecting how weird it would be to have plastic in my mouth. Im on day 5 of my first tray and I feel a lot better now pain-wise but my lisp is extremely bad and Im still kind of clenching my teeth while trying to figure out how to relax my mouth. I was also not aware of how obvious attachments are, especially because theyre on my teeth that Im most self conscious about. We will all get through this together ƒI am in the same boat n around same length of time, I hate the feel of plastic in my mouth, sleep is my only relief. Hang in there, I am trying and can't wait for this to be over.I never got braces before but I was fine after the first few days with Invisalign. Even when I first got them it only hurt to put them in, my teeth felt itchy if that makes sense?? LolIts probably just very mild soreness that youre feeling. I do know some people feel more pain than others with their aligners, but I doubt its as bad as wire tightening day for braces. I started my Invisalign treatment recently and its very comfortable. Im sure therell be soreness here and there in the future, but its so worth it being able to brush and floss easily. I really dont miss my braces giving me canker sores for 3 years straight either.Oh yeah Im currently on tray 12, by week 2 it felt weirder having them out than having them in. You definitely get used to itYes! I get that itchy sensation as well.  Never had pain with it just itch.  First week, I felt like scratching my gums out.  Now week 9, the process is very easy.  The itch occasionally comes back when I changed trays but I just take that as the tray working.Yeah the itch definitely goes away, I think for me it came back on tray 11 the first time I put them in but gone away again now and Im swapping for tray 13 today. Oh me too if I get a little itch I know my teeth are movingI was thinking this while reading the comments. The pain/soreness is pretty minimal compared to the torture that braces were.I've been in orthodontic appliances off and on since age 5. My invisalign wasn't as painful as the first day of braces but the brackets definitely feel sharper to me, and on day 3 the bottom tray was irritating my tongue. Also all of my friends told me their invisalign took longer than it was supposed to because they never kept the trays in, but I was afraid to take mine out and felt like having them in was more comfortable than having them out, due to the sharp attachments on my front teeth. \\n\\nAlso my parents paid for my retainers and braces as a child and forced me to do it. Last week as I worked a bunch of overtime to pay for the treatment I was really questioning why I chose to do this to myself.I just put in tray 4 this morning (weekly trays). Finally getting my groove.3rd tray in, no longer feels horrible to put new ones in.Month 16 here. You genuinely become so used to it that it doesn't matter at all anymore. It's like wearing contact lenses.I'm on my first week day 4. Did your dentist tell you how long or how many trays? My dentist just put them in and sent me on my way lol. I have another appointment in few days for my next tray.\\n\\nThe pain is getting better. Day one and two were awful.I was given all of my boxes with my trays on day one. On the box I was able to see I had 50 trays. Mine didnt explicitly say either :)I agree!!! I thought this was such a mistake for the first 3 days and now Im 18 days in and its totally a routineMy first week I thought I made the biggest mistake of my life. Today is week #3 and it's not as bad. Still sucks but not as bad (also just changed trays 1 hour ago)this ! i stg .. first 2 weeks for me were terrible. i had a sore achy mouth, taking them out was painful and putting them in, wake up crying because my mouth is just sore and i would feel the need to teethe like a baby (i still do ’…) but .. week 3 i got used to it and it was a routine. \\n\\ntrust me guys you'll get used to itIt definitely, absolutely gets better!I'm on my first week. I have a bottom tray and a carriere appliance on my top. It's uncomfortable but I'm excited about it. Only 18 months to go!How long did they say you needed to wear your carriere appliance for? I have to get the carriere appliance on at the end of the month and I'm so scared it's going to be painful (and annoying). Once it's off I'm going on Invisalign though.They said it will be on for 4 to 5 months. It hasn't been too painful yet so try not to worry! The first night was the most uncomfortable so far but it wasn't terrible. I'm already starting to get used to it!Thats comforting to hear xD I work at an elementary school so Im hoping I can get the carriere off by the time I restart work in the fall! The carriere is the only thing Im freaking out about lol.Im on week 1, just 5 days into it. On my third day the bottom retainer seemed to sit lower, and its made my tongue a bit sore. Im going to get some dental wax, but apart from that, no problems at all and no pain. Im petrified of dental work so this was a big step for me. So far, so good. \\x81Im at the start of Week 7 and barely notice them anymore. The first 3 weeks were a big adjustment, but it gets better with time!I remember my first week and my tongue had so many cuts on it due to the plastic rubbing against it but now I got used to it and can speak clearly without even feeling the alignersThank you for this!Thank you because I really am wondering what the hell I signed on for. Day 1 and got my teeth filed down to make space... it all feels weird and uncomfortable!Im on day one and ipr was easily the worst thing that has ever happened to me, sitting there listening and feeling them shave your enamel is honestly disturbingI just can't believe my dentist put a gap in between my front teeth, I did not know that was part of it!Today is my first day! But I have buttons on the inside and outside of my molars because eventually I'll get tabs put on my teeth. I have elastic too. It's gonna be a loooooot of work the next couple of years.The first few days were horrible and now Im changing trays tomorrow and so scared Im starting over again after Ive just started to adjust. Also mid way through my pregcy so that doesnt help either. Im on try 8 and I usually clean my trays with either soap and water or Retainer brite cleaning tabs, but never toothbrush and toothpaste. My ortho said I didnt need to do that. Soap and water actually works just fine for daily use. I only wear them a week before changing them, they never smell.Bless you, I really needed to hear this!\", 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'facial appearance', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'financial concerns', 'tray time management', 'oral hygiene'], 'scores': [0.2761686146259308, 0.16343076527118683, 0.13798874616622925, 0.12551870942115784, 0.11241545528173447, 0.09935418516397476, 0.08512355387210846]}, {'sequence': \"Sorry for the gross looking pics.

I think its because of anxiety I tend to suck in my cheeks a lot.Yeap, happens when sucking cheeks.Ya those are where your top and bottom teeth sit together. Perfectly normal.

Never noticed before!Me too hahahahaCalled linea alba, is normal. I bite my cheecks so I've always had it. Now that i have Invisalign i developed it on my upper lip, just noticed it a couple days ago. Nothing to worry about.I do have this for days after I change trays. I think I bite my inside cheek while sleepingI have them too.  My dentist told me its from sucking my cheeks in unconsciously (pre Invisalign) but now theyre more pronounced from being squeezed in between the plastic traysI have them too.. thought it was because my aligners rubbed my cheek, maybe? Tried searching on here to see if anyone else got them so, thanks for posting. Seems like a common side effect. Bummer though and hope it goes away.NormalForgot to say. Im only on tray 2, started Invisalign November 6th and these lines formed in my mouth literally the second day after, and I know with my experience with the regular clear retainer after braces, it does not go away. Something about any type of aligner or retainer in my mouth causes my mouth to form these linesI had these in the first month. They go away. Use peroxyl mouthwash.I have them close to the ends of my mouth where the rubber band rests against my cheeks.Shouldn't matter as no one is going to be looking inside your mouth!

Hang in there!Looks amazing!!!Thank you!Ahhhh so happy for you!!!!!!! ¹\\x8dThank you!!How long did it take?About 4 months.Wow! Thats phenomenal! And how much is it costing if you dont mind me asking? My case is pretty similar to yours so Im a bit curious!It really is. When I saw my clincheck and the dentist told me 16 trays, I was like \"Yeah right\". But here I am. Still work to be done, but I\\'m super impressed. My dentist was having some sort of special when I signed up so I believe I got about ~$1000 off. My insurance picked up half and I paid the rest. My total out of pocket was around $2300. I have the comprehensive plan so I\\'m definitely doing as many refinements as I can.Your ortho will have you wear rubber bands to fix the overbite with your refinements.That\\'s what I\\'m hoping for. I asked him at the beginning of treatment if I\\'d need elastics at any point and he said he doesn\\'t really use them. But then he kind of alluded that it would be possible in refinements. I guess I\\'ll find out at my next appointment.He\\'d be crazy not to. Elastics will take care of that in no time.Ya I\\'ll beg for them if I have to, lol. Do you happen to know if it\\'s common to fix an overbite after fixing an overjet? I was just wondering why both wouldn\\'t have been corrected at the same time.I don\\'t have an exact answer for that. My daughter is in braces right now and she had an overjet and overbite. It seemed like the overjet was better before our ortho started elastics for the overbite.\\n\\nI had braces as a kid but over time my bite shifted and I had some mild crowding. My TMJ problems and clenching got really bad so I decided to do Invisalign. I have a small overbite and elastics have made a big difference in a short time. Unfortunately for me, I\\'ll be wearing elastics for a long time to fix the rest of my bite.I see. I also had braces as a kid, with elastics too and they were introduced later in the treatment. I just figured this time around maybe something would be different because I\\'m older. Also a little odd that my dentist is hoping I\\'ll be satisfied after these initial trays. He\\'s been kind of pushing for me to be done and I told him at my last appointment weeks ago there\\'s no way I\\'ll be happy after 16. Oh well. Thanks for the response and good luck in your treatment!From what I\\'ve seen, it\\'s common for dentists to want to be done after the initial period. Not sure why exactly. My orthodontist is more than happy to do what needs done even if it takes longer. I wouldn\\'t have gone through my regular dentist for this for sure though.I have a feeling it\\'s just about $. ~$6000 for 4 months of work vs possibly 5 years?Very probably. My regular dentist ignored something I mentioned at least once a year until it finally went bad enough to require fixing and of course money.That sucks. If I had actively sought invisalign out I would have gotten a few consults but my dentist offered it to me. I had always wanted it, but for years I wasn\\'t a candidate so I was thrilled to find out I could finally get it. I was a little nervous going through a dentist, but when I was a kid my orthodontist kind of screwed up my treatment and took my braces off too soon. So I took my chances with my dentist and I can\\'t say I\\'m not pleased. He\\'s aware I want refinements and I\\'m going to make him work for his money.Good on you! I hesitated until I was 35 to do this so I feel you on the anxiety of it all!Don\\'t feel bad... I\\'m 42!I am fixing my overjet too. Could you take your picture in same angle as you had in \\'before\\' picture.https://i.imgur.com/MLwLYs7.jpg\\n\\nDoes that help? As you can see I still have a large overbite, but the flaring is mostly gone and my teeth are straight up and down finally. Fingers crossed refinements can fix the overbite.Your teeth look fabulous. Must be tears of joy. Well deserved. We cry with you. Congratulations!Aww thank you. Absolutely tears of joy!Wow, the results are amazing. Your teeth look beautifully white even in the left image, could you please tell us your oral hygiene routine?Thank you. I floss and brush twice a day with toothpaste and I do a quick brush with just water after I\\'ve eaten something, but to keep my teeth white I use a mixture of mouthwash and peroxide. I use the mouthwash that has fluoride. When the bottle of mouthwash is about 1/3 of the way down I fill it back up with peroxide. Swish with the mixture for a good minute before brushing. If I do it every day, my gums will get a little irritated so I\\'ll either do it every few days or do it every day, but swish for only 15/30 seconds. Been doing it for years. Sometimes I\\'ll floss with peroxide too. I use floss picks so I fill the peroxide bottle cap and dip the pick into it before I floss each tooth.Thats one hell of a routine you got going on there! Thank you for taking your time and writing it down , and all the best for your remaining Invisalign journey  :)Lol, it is but I\\'m so used to doing it now. Mouthwash and peroxide are permanently on my grocery shopping lists. You can always just dilute the peroxide with water too. You\\'re quite welcome!

I had consults to see if I needed grafting years ago (because it bugged me, not because my dentist was concerned, if you would believe it) and was told no, its fine.question for those who had braces as a teen and now have to get invisalign/braces again.. how ? was that from not wearing retainers ?:oI had braces as a teen. Wore my retainer religiously and then my wisdom teeth came in. Got them taken out and less than a year later was diagnosed with cancer. One of the medicines they put me on to bump up my white blood cell production (in my bone marrow) caused bone pain like crazy including in my jaw. I literally had dreams of all my teeth falling out due to the jaw pain and would unconsciously flick my retainer out with my tongue in the middle of the night so I stopped wearing it. When I was done treatment and ready to start wearing it again, it didn\\'t fit. I attribute it to the short time between my wisdom teeth removal and when i stopped wearing the retainer; things just hadnt figured out where they needed to stay yet.\\n\\nI say this long-winded story because I had a dentist tell me \"maybe you\\'ll be more responsible wearing your retainer now that it\\'s your own money paying for treatment\" and I absolutely berated him and pulled the cancer card HARD. I would have loved to keep wearing my retainer but I had bigger fish to fry.Honestly, screw that dentist. Even if you didnt have medical stuff getting in the way, you were a teen. Last I checked kids at that age arent the best at foreseeing the outcomes of every decision they make.Exactly! I used to think I would never make it to 30 so I didn\\'t give af about any long term health decisionsI really  hope you are cancer free now! Stories like yours confirm tha retaines cannot be worn for  life. When \"just life happens \" you cannot wear retainers. Sometimes serious health problems occurs, sometimes a woman vomits 20 times a day while is pregt,  some people have accidents and they have to be hospitalized. They just cannot wear retainers...   It is just not realistic to ask someone  to wear retainer for lifetime.10 years cancer free in a few months! Totally agree. I basically didnt wear it for a year and while it didnt get totally reversed, it was bad enough that it took 6 months of invisalign to fix. Just completed last month[deleted]Same here. I wish I would have scrounged up money somehow to pay for a new one by babysitting or saving birthday money or something. But I thought that it had probably been long enough and they wouldn\\'t shift. If only I would have known I would need to wear them literally FOREVER and that I would have to go through this someday to fix it.Yep! Had braces from ages 9-13. Wore my retainers religiously until 18, when I met my husband. I was too embarrassed and obviously naive. Fast forward ten years and now I am in Invisalign for 6 months. Hopefully.\\n\\nIts funny though, I had a large gap between by teeth when I was nine and had to have a frenectomy when I got my braces off. Now those two front teeth were starting to overlap.My 9 month treatment plan of Invisalign is going on 26 months and Im picking up my 4th set of refinements next week.Thankth. That\\'th reathuring. \\n\\nBut really, I\\'m very sorry.I was never given retainers as a teen, so my teeth slowly moved back to exactly where they were before the 2 years of pain and money :(\\n\\nDefinitely made sure I got a retainer after Invisalign, and wearing it every night now!Why did you need so many refinements?TBH I dont know, the difference from when I started the treatment to after the first 21 trays was HUGE. Each set of refinements after that barely moved anything, in the end I told the Ortho I dont need anymore :pI wore my retainers constantly because I went through hellish orthodontia, including headgear and rubber bands that crisscrossed the front of my mouth.\\nMy ortho didnt properly correct my bite, slanted my canines inward (as Ive heard many orthos have a tendency to do), and I have a dental implant because I was born without a tooth which ” to me ” looks exacerbated by the slanted canine.\\nEssentially, I went in for more cosmetic reasons and found out I had functional issues as well. Reading everyone elses comments, Im just grateful Ive been able to get all this done. My mouth would be a right mess if I couldnt.Sounds like my situation, except I never got the implant.  I wonder how common the missing adult tooth is.  One of my children is also missing the same adult tooth, but on the other side (mirrored.)  I actually went in for the functional issues though, \\'cause I\\'ve been grinding and breaking my teeth at night.I had my braces from grade 4-7 (2001-2004?). My ortho told me to wear the retainer religiously for a year then only at night for a year.I never wanted to have braces and I found the experience, as a teenager, to be painful and kinda traumatic. I had them from age 10 to 13.5 and it was a really tough time emotionally, socially, and physically -- because they were painful. Once they were done, I never wanted to look back and refused to wear the retainers. 23 years later, here we are. Wish Invisalign had been an option back then!We are living in an orthodontia parallel universe! I had my braces ages 11 to 14.5. Super painful and traumatic experience for me as well! Had to switch drs after the 1st got caught selling prescriptions, the new dr ripped off all my old (clear braces) and put on traditional metal. When the braces finally came off, I didnt want to wear the retainer, I attempted to put in it a couple days later but my teeth already moved enough it didnt fit and I just didnt care. And here I am 24 years later and I started my 1st of 30 trays today.Def parallel orthodontia universe. I started Invisalign on the same day as you :)super similar to my story. between the pain and the teasing, i just wanted it to stop!Yes. And now Im an adult and dont care what people think, and also am paying for it myself/care about the result more, hence willing to put up with things if I feel I will eventually get value.i wore mine for a few years, but not long enough apparentlySame, and I dont remember being told that Id need to wear them forever. I was 14/15 though, so I probably just didnt œhear\\x9d that part.solid point. i was 13, i was busy growing boobs and everything else kind of went in one ear and out the otherYeap, was never even told to wear them -.-This always baffles me when people don\\'t wear their retainers. As someone who would have LOVED to have been able to have braces younger... We were just stupid poor. I was always so jealous of other kids.My husband\\'s teeth shifted also and when I asked him if he had lost his retainer like I did, he was like no I still had it I was just sick of wearing it and it was a pain in the ass. I was like WHAAAT. :/  and I don\\'t think he has any plans to get his fixed either.i got braces way too young - i wasnt even getting teased for my crappy teeth yet, but i was the first kid with braces and sure got teased for that. i had them forever and resented them and just wanted them off. im grateful now that i had them, but really wish my parents had waited until i was old enough to want them and be on board with it all.Didn\\'t wear retainers but I don\\'t have enough space on my bottom so my wisdom teeth coming through lead to over crowding that wasn\\'t there when I had my original bracesYes, I had braces in middle school, wore retainers religiously up until a year after collegethen the dog got them off the night stand when she was about six months oldI thought it had been long enough but my bite started slowly shifting and my bottom teeth started getting crowded againMy Orthodontist was like the oldest/meanest guy I have ever met, but the only one in my small town. Always super rude and talked down to me. I hated the whole thing. He ended up pulling them off after two years, and then a year later my final molars started growing in (not wisdom teeth, I only have one that never came down). Tried to keep wearing my retainers, but my teeth changed so much that one day one of them broke when putting them in. I hated my Ortho so much I never wanted to go back, so I just let my teeth get crooked again.\\n\\nNow as an adult I found a super nice Ortho.I lost my retainer because I put it on a napkin to eat, wadded it up and accidentally threw it away. My parents got me another one. But then the same thing happened again so they said nope we aren\\'t paying for another replacement. It took years for them to shift. And the shifting got worse over time. :(Oh goodness, Im so sorry that happened. :( I hope you had a good journey with Invisalign. \\x8f\\x8f»I had braces for a few years as a teen. When they came off, the gap in my top front teeth was closed, but I distinctly remember that my bottom crowding still wasn\\'t 100% fixed. I was given a retainer and naturally, I didn\\'t wear them as much as I should. I was quite irresponsible with them, but in fairness, my teeth moved SO QUICKLY when I took off the retainers to eat, brush my teeth, etc., and that caused a lot of pain once I put them back in. Honestly, I probably should have had the braces on for longer because my teeth weren\\'t fully straight, and between how quickly my teeth shifted and my clear lack of compliance with the retainers, SOMEONE should have fitted me for a permanent retainer. I know they have their own issues, but maybe I wouldn\\'t be in my 30s doing Invisalign.I had my braces in the early 90s. Back then we were only told to wear retainers for 1-2 years. No one said anything about life time. I\\'m a rule follower so if I\\'d ever been told to wear a retainer forever I would have done it. My teeth slowly shifted over time and now I\\'m doing Invisalign almost 30 years after having braces, so I guess the braces were effective for a good 25 years or so...\\n\\nBut now that the science/thinking has changed on retainers I will definitely be wearing for life after my Invisalign is done.Same!! Mine came off in the late 90s, and like most people back then, I was told to wear my retainer for a year, which I faithfully did (I didnt question doctors back then sadly, but today, I do my own research). I was led to believe the results would be permanent. It wasnt until years later that I noticed my teeth had shifted. This happened to my brother and sister as well. :/ Currently, Im waiting on my trays! I hope your journey went well!unfortunately, for me, yes”i was fourteen/fifteen years old when i got my braces off (looking back on my photos from when i first got them off make me astonished at how picture-perfect and gorgeous my teeth were) but they gave me metal retainers that looked not so dissimilar from braces. as a teen entering high school, i thought œfuck this\\x9d and only wore them at night and bc they were so painful/uncomfortable, i eventually stopped wearing them outright. however, they were fine for a majority of my high school career and now that im entering my second year of college, my teeth are starting to majorly shift back. as a child, my two front teeth protruded like crazy”they made me look like a rabbit. now that im nineteen, its starting to look very unappealing and unattractive and above all, it hurts. i cant stop running my tongue across them and the gap in between my two front feet and my other teeth. before i get any older, ive decided to do invisalign. luckily, my orthodontist said itll take ten months or so or maybe even less. i am only on my first tray-lol!Never wore my retainers/trays after braces.I\\'ve got my braces only on my top teeth when I was teen and I\\'ve never got retainers (I don\\'t know why)...And I am missing bottom teeth so one of my top tooth went lower. Now I am on Invisalign because of bottom (I\\'ve got crowded tooth) and also because of top moved tooth. The next steps are refinements and after that tooth implant for missing bottom teeth. And what I like to mention is - I am from small town and somehow nobody told me about this movement or necessity of tooth implant until I didn\\'t move to capital city. And I was one the patient who went for every year check-up to dentist. But my braces dentist wasn\\'t my regular dentist, so .. ·\\x8f¼\\x8dï¸\\x8fI wore my retainers religiously, even through college. When I got my wisdom teeth out, things got a little loose. By that time, I was heavy into a very stressful engineering program and started grinding my teeth in my sleep. I ended up giving my lower retainer hairline fractures that I didn\\'t even see until my teeth had already started to move. I went back to my ortho office, found out my dr had retired, and the new guy didn\\'t make retainers at a discount for old patients. $500 for a piece of plastic that would only hold my teeth in the already misaligned position seemed like a damn scam, so I just didn\\'t do it. I was 21 at the time. \\n\\nNow I\\'m 28, have an incredibly stressful (and satisfying) job, and the time & money to get them fixed. Found a new ortho, allocated some FSA dollars, and got a better bite guard from my dentist for the constant nighttime grinding. I\\'m on tray 2 of 4, my treatment is only 40 days long, and I\\'m at peace with my decision to opt out of that $500 retainer 7 years ago.I had braces when I was in my 9th grade. Wore retainers for a while but wasn\\'t consistent. But after few years when my Wisdom teeth started erupting, it was impacted. Because of the impacted wisdom teeth, my alignment changed. And also got a supernumerary teeth out of no where. So here I am with Invisalign. I\\'m currently 20 :)I had braces in middle school. It was mainly to get a tooth that was growing on top of my other teeth down and into position. It also straightened my teeth, but I really did not care about my appearance back then and just wanted to get out of braces, so we ended treatment early to where my teeth looked good but not as good as possible. \\n\\nI wore my retainer probably 75% of the nights but sadly my dog (a puppy at the time) got to them and chewed it up. I didnt remind my mom heavily enough and we took way too long to schedule an appointment. \\n\\nNow my bottom teeth are overlapping a center bottom tooth a bit and my front top teeth are a bit buck and one is slightly lower than the other.I had braces at 14 and then puberty hit at 17 lol. My bottom jaw finally developed and essentially ended up in a bite where my front top and bottom teeth hit. Front teeth slowly chipped away so now Im on a 6 month(ish) Invisalign treatmentYes not wearing a retainer was an expensive mistake for sureI think we can all safely agree that 90s/00s orthodontics sucked. I feel for my parents, who shelled out big bucks for about 5 years of good teeth.This! My 90s ortho told me to wear my retainer for a year after braces and then I could stop. Sadly, I believed him! So did my brother and sister and we all have crooked teeth now after braces.So cute hahaI feel seen. Wish I\\'d kept wearing that retainer...‹\\x8dï¸\\x8fI feel attacked —¡I was told to wear my retainers for at least a year and thats it. Stopped wearing them in college and my teeth shifted a ton!Same! It seems this is what most orthodontists told everyone back then. Half the adults at my orthodontists had braces as a kid.Just started!I don\\'t have Invisalign yet but I\\'m planning on it and yup this will be me.Definitely how my teeth are feelingThis is me.I don\\'t have braces as a teen but I want to get Invisalign in the future and this artwork is so cute ’This is reeeeeal, this is meeee lol.Sagittal appliance and braces from 11-14.

Just got scanned this week and should get my first set in 4-6 weeksSimilar but also different. I had phase one of braces in forth grade. Then my perants had a messy divorce so my teeth got forgotten in the mess. I started invisalign in ninth grade because my bottom teeth were very crooked.Ahahaha this is me. Had braces from age 8-15. Wore a retainer until 18. Was told by my ortho that once I got my wisdom teeth out I didnt need to wear my retainer anymore. Turns out that was a whole lie! Now Im in Invisalign, but I only need 12 trays. I will definitely keep up with the retainer this time.The reason people why people get crooked teeth is because of bad oral habits. Braces only straighten teeth but do not fix the habits. Gotta make sure to fix the habits so that the teeth do not get crooked again.\\nLeaving mouth open during periods of rest like watching tv, playing a game, reading is not good. Also so is leaving tongue down - the front and back of tongue should be fully up against the palate at all times of rest. This supports the width of the palate so that your teeth do not crowd. It\\'s important to always nasal breathe so to keep these good oral habits.Trying to redpill people about mewing on an orthodontics sub, a noble effort.', 'labels': ['physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'oral hygiene', 'self-consciousness', 'facial appearance', 'tray time management', 'financial concerns', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns'], 'scores': [0.20938923954963684, 0.1501990705728531, 0.14994601905345917, 0.14528049528598785, 0.1267244517803192, 0.1181342601776123, 0.10032650083303452]}, {'sequence': 'Switching to Invisalign mid-Braces treatment?Were any of you in the middle of traditional braces treatment and decide to have your braces removed for Invisalign? \\n\\nIf so, how did your orthodontist respond? Im thinking of asking for this at my next appointment in a few weeks.I had metal for 6 months and switched to Invisalign because I moved across the country and they told me they could cut my time in half lol. Your ortho probably wont care because they will charge you a ton to do it. You should just research and make sure they can confidently do Invisalign. My ortho for metal braces was one of the best in my area but a total flop with Invisalign. And now the opposite is true, the ortho Im with now is one of the top Invisalign orthos in the world but told me he wasnt confident handling my metal braces. Also, my opinion is that Invisalign is a way bigger pain in the but. I have a horrible lisp, you cant eat whenever you want, cant drink coffee all day, no sugary treats throughout the day, and its embarrassing to be in public trying to pry your trays off your teeth to eat. Also, Ive noticed I spend a LOT more time planning my day to figure out where I will eat, what I will eat, setting alarms so I dont forget to put the trays in, focusing on where I put the trays so my kids/dogs dont eat them. Maybe its not a big deal for other people but its a huge chore for me. The positive is that Ill be done in 6 months and still had 2 years left in metal lol.This is so similar to my situation. Ive been in my braces for 8 months and am relocating to another state. Im really considering the Invisalign after the move because my ortho told me I have 1.5 years left and man I just dont know if I can last that much longer lol. I know Invisalign can be such a hassle, but cutting down my treatment plan would be so worth it to me lol. Do you mind if I ask how the cost changed? Im currently paying $100 monthly for my braces with an overall cost of $2700. Fingers crossed the Invisalign doesnt increase by a few thousand lol. Also thank you for your helpful reply!!Yaaa my old ortho is still working out how much I owe. But basically they told me that my insurance pays a few times a year instead of monthly. So I owe $2000 to close out my account for the metal braces and when insurance pays out Im œsupposed\\x9d to get paid back. I sincerely doubt that will happen. Then Invisalign was total $4000 which I just paid up front because my insurance wasnt going to cover any of it. My metal braces were supposed to be $3000k total out of pocket.

Im now worried though that Ill feel self conscious if Im talking funny with Invisalign!But you\\'ll look good doing it!\\n\\nIt didn\\'t take long to learn to talk with them in for me.Amazing. Have you also heard if braces are more effective? I was told that last time but that was 7 years ago now!I think a huge part of that is the user error factor. If you arent disciplined with your Invisalign, they wont work. With braces, you dont really have a choice. \\n\\nAs an adult, I trust myself to take the investment seriously.

I had braces as a teen and now my Invisalign treatment is mostly for crowding, nothing crazy, so it didn\\'t really matter to meIf you do get a lisp or anything, itll go away eventually and youll be fine! Plus its way more noticeable to you than to anyone else I promiseFew reasons. 1. Braces horror stories 2. Invisalign isnt obvious unless youre pretty close up. 3. Its way easier to clean your teeth and floss. 4. They are removable (and nobody has ever noticed attachments without them on). Never wanted braces but wanted straight teeth. I would start Invisalign all over. Its been nothing but a great experience.People already confuse me for a teenager, I didnt need to help that out.SameI feel you haha, same hereI already had braces when I was a teen, and I wanted something less obvious this time around!Comparing the two, do you prefer Invisalign? Are they working as well as the braces did?I also preferred Invisalign. Braces dug into my cheeks all the time and were harder to clean. My lips were also forever chapped with braces. Invisalign is also less appointments!Price was similar. I am an ongoing teacher so I don\\'t want traditional braces.Im a teacher too so I absolutely feel your pain with thisOhh cool! Š Keep in mind that the first time will be a big struggle. It\\'s quite inconvenient always having to remove those trays once you start to get hungry. You have to wear your trays for 22 hours a day which can you to feel pressured. \\nAt the beginning, it took me 20 minutes each time to remove them, but it will get easier and now I feel like it is the most normal thing in the world.Yeah I do feel quite overwhelmed with that tbh! I actually had both around 7 years ago. I actually preferred braces, but I wasnt teaching yet and feel like I was younger and maybe felt I could pull off braces more. Being older and a teacher I feel way more inclined to go down the Invisalign route. Did you lisp at first?Do the kids notice the Invisalign??No one noticed it yet or at least, no one said anything. I have a lot of attachments (two on each incisor) but I don\\'t find them to be very noticeable.Would you feel comfortable showing me(could DM) a pic of how they look. Obviously only if youre comfortable!Same! And none of the children or most people for that matter noticed my invisalign. When I try to make the children feel good about their braces I show them mine, but I have to tell them exactly where to look to notice them.I have a front facing job where people already question my expertise based on my age, plus I was due to get married!Vanity and canker sore prone, also hygiene is way easier to maintain because you have full access to your teeth for brushing and theres less places for food to get stuck inCanker sore prone is huge for me also. Ive gotten a few bad ones just from getting used to attachments. I cannot imagine the pain Id be in with metal braces.My orthodontist. I wanted to have conventional braces but she said the treatment plan & cost are just the same. So I chose Invisalign over braces :)Less check in and emergency visits- i knew i was going to be moving out of town mid treatment and didnt want to do as many return trips for invisalign. it was basically either every month for braces or every 4 months for invisalignYeh good point. Are braces better at moving teeth or has that improved since I last investigated?I feel like generally braces are more predictable at moving teeth since its less user dependent/error, but typically seems like cases for braces can also be completed with invisalign. Definitely think invisalign has made more and more advances over the years of what they can accomplish, like closing bigger gaps and rotating teethBraces are better for teeth that need to rotate but thats not to say invisaligns cant do thatAgreed. Easier and more predictable rotations with braces, but not impossible with invisalignMy ortho put a tiny brace on my most wonky tooth for a couple of weeks before scanning for my aligners to help pull it round as much as possible, it really helped and was barely noticeable!Im a special Ed teacher and my kiddos can be aggressive so I was worried about getting punched in the face and braces tearing up my mouth.Orthodontist said that since I grind my teeth, it would cut down on grinding tooth to tooth. Once my teeth are done, Ill be fitted for a night guard.Biggest reason was that Invisalign looks much better  and they were only 1000$ more expensive than classic bracesi didnt. i wanted regular braces because the insurance would cover most of it, but since we are correcting a popping jaw (high strung jaw muscle) and an underbite, my ortho said invisalign would be gentler on my bones and ease the tension on my muscle more slowly as my bite got corrected. \\n\\nso i had to go with it. im paying for it all out of pocket because insurance thinks invisalign is œcosmetic\\x9d, despite the fact that my choice was this or surgery. :(Cost and timescale was the same but with Invisalign you can enjoy your results while theyre still happening, rather than having to have a mouth full of metal and only enjoying your smile when theyre completely done. \\n\\nAlso just the thought of metal braces made me start breaking out in mouth sores lolLiterally only that you can\\'t really see it.I have shitty enamel. Invisaline wasnt a thing when I was a teen. Finally got around to it in my 40s b/c my teeth were shifting to the point of discomfort.I had braces from ages 17-19. When I needed a second treatment after shifting (12 years later) it wasnt even a question. And yep, 100% my own vanity. But at 32 and also being in a job that involves quite a bit of public speaking, I wanted something more discreet. A little bit of a lisp at first but it was just with the 1st tray. \\n\\nTry out some consultations and see what an ortho has to say. Bite issues are often fixed better with braces. But I think some of it comes down to the fact that you dont have the option to take them off. Theyre working 24/7 without you even thinking about it.I really didn\\'t want braces at 47. I just have an overbite and some gaps Ive always wanted to correct and Invisalign seems like a good solution.Quicker results, less visits to dentist, cheaper, less pain (braces can rub on the inside of your mouth), i grind my teeth so more protection there. \\nthe aesthetics didnt really bother me but the above reasons made it an easy choice.My Orthodontist actually has be doing both traditional braces on my lower with a carriere distalizer on top then Im switching to Invisalign. The main reason is to correct my overbite, as Invisalign isnt as effective with that. \\n\\nI would suggest talking to a few orthodontists and see what they suggest. Mine said that Invisalign cant do 100% of what traditional braces can do. It all depends on what you want your results to be and where your teeth are at currently. Based on what he told me Invisalign could do versus what this more hybrid treatment between the two could do, I opted to suck it up and do both even though I really didnt want to. \\n\\nAlso, if youre a teacher, depending on the grade you teach the kids may love it. I had a middle school teacher get traditional braces while I was in school and everyone thought it was so cool to have a teacher be like one of us.Thanks for your reply. I have quite a bad over bite and open bite, as you can see here \\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/u49arSp\\n\\nI need jaw surgery.\\n\\nWhats a carriere distalizer? \\n\\nThanks! Im definitely planning on getting a few opinions. \\n\\nI have previous done a combination of Invisalign and braces, but stupidly didnt go through with surgery and now have a terrible dry mouth and lips issue from mouth breathing. Im dreading the process again but telling myself the end will be worth it \\n\\nI am a high school teacher. I want to tell myself theyll think Im cool, but I already look young so Ill probably look dorky and kid like or something haha. Im unwell and not working atm, in fact I wish I spent the last year in lockdown doing it! No one would have seen me. \\n\\nThanks for all your advice btwhttps://www.drgarrickfwong.com/orthodontic-services/carriere-motion-3d-appliance/\\n\\nMine is clear and you can barely notice it. Its a device that attaches to your canine tooth to the second to last back tooth. They sometimes will do full traditional braces on the bottom or a bracket on one back tooth on each side. Then you just wear bands for a while to move your canine teeth back so then Invisalign can do what it is good at and shift the teeth into the right place. I had a similar overbite to yours, but did not have an open bite. I liked this approach because it wasnt so obvious I had braces on my lower and you couldnt really tell I had anything on my upper except people sometimes seeing the bands. My orthodontist flat out told me Invisalign would help correct it, but Id still have an overbite if I only did Invisalign. \\n\\nI started with that device in March, I have three more weeks to overcorrect then Ill be on Invisalign. Ive been really happy with it overall. A bit self conscious when someone mentions it, but I figure who cares really. I try to have the mentality that at least Im doing something to correct an issue that Ive always been self conscious about and soon Ill not be. \\n\\nIf you arent working right now, Id definitely try to start the process sooner rather than later! Youll be so much happier to just get it done. You look young enough where I think your students would think it was cool. Youll look more like them, so more relatable. Thats just me though. \\x81Also, Im 29 and figured Im still young enough to not look too crazy with braces. I would have likely opted to only do Invisalign if I was a lot older, just because of vanity and the stigma around braces being for younger kids. LolNot as noticeable and less pain to lips/gums/cheeks. Also oral hygiene. I am cavity prone and dont think I could keep regular braces as clean.I chose Invisaligns because it is less painful (usually) less trips to the ortho, and less food limitations and I was told it wouldnt take as long (depending on refinements etc) However, depending on your routine and habits it is a big lifestyle change. So prepare yourself if you do get Invisaligns lolPain and beauty lolThe price and time length was the same. Who knew? I thought traditional braces would be cheaper.I do martial arts, so with Invisalign you\\'re still able to wear a normal mouth guard (which is important for concussion prevention) while with traditional braces you generally don\\'t have a molded mouth guard and if you get hit in the face there\\'s a fair chance the braces will cut into your lip.Im moving countries so the orthodontist advised Invisalign! I can have virtual consultations, otherwise I probably wouldve chose standard braces \\x81No insurance so the cost of braces and invisalign would be the exact same for me so I figured I\\'d go the invisible route lolInvisalign was slightly less expensive. The work I needed was pretty minor as I had traditional braces as a teen. If itd been more complicated, I couldve gone with traditional braces. I also have three crowns that I didnt want to put brackets on and was worried about.My orthodontist recommended it... I think he said  I\\'d need bands if we did braces. I was just glad to hear I don\\'t have to give up apples and popcorn.Visibility and when I got given a list of things to avoid with braces and it included bagels and was way longer than expected. Also Invisalign is a lot more gentle. Like youre getting adjustments every 1-2 weeks so its a lot less than the adjustment you get every 6-8 weeks.Horror stories about wire and sores. Same price for me. I was a good candidate. Practice for retainers which really helped. I wanted to be able to floss. Had I know about Covid I probably would have gone traditional though just because there is so much more experience out there with traditional and they are superior for rotationsSeveral things, cost, feasibility, compliance, vanity... \\n\\nThe prices were similar according to my ortho. I didn\\'t think I\\'d be a candidate for Invisalign going into the consultation, after self diagnosing my teeth as a \"complex case\" and the ortho said, \"Yeah, it\\'d be a complicated Invisalign case, but it would also be a complicated fixed braces case\".\\n\\nAnd I always hated using those interdental brushes and much prefer floss.Im 33 and could afford it. I had wire braces as a kid. They were painful, scratched my mouth, and I remember being taken out of school frequently to get them tightened.There were limitations of food I could eat because the brackets might break and the metal brackets always make mouths look significantly different to me and Invisalign isnt really noticing at all if someone doesnt know you have it!Cheaper with my insurance than actual braces haha1. Vanity. 2. My bite issues were such that I would have needed to do the top first, and then the bottom so it was going to take double the time 3. I have a job where I\\'m in front of people all day.  4. This is my most honest answer, since I\\'m an adult, I felt like I would look some type of way with metal in my mouth.  Like infantile or something.Vanity Because Im a 22 recent graduate looking for a jobI was good with whatever,  but none of my five consults wanted to do anything but Invisalign. Well, one offered a deep discount on an in-house system, but everyone else was very anti-braces. Even Damon or the ceramics I wore the first time aroud.How interesting. Do you know why?Honestly, from what I can tell reading online, Invisalign is less office time, less materials thus more money. If you have compliant patients, you can increase patient counts. Especially, if theyre using scanbox technologies which use AIs to do most of the monitoring, its even less time for the provider. The entry costs are probably steep, but ultimately if they work it right its way more money for them.[deleted]Well I guess youre meant to wear them 22 hours a day. So taking them out for an hour long commitment would still work, right? \\n\\nIm feeling so anxious about committing to braces too. I cant believe I did the last time I did. \\n\\nHowever, I did both last time and braces definitely seemed to work better. Maybe because I wasnt as committed to Invisalign but also maybe the technology has improved too!Wait a second, you\\'ve already had braces and Invisalign before?!? How long ago was that? And how many years/months did you have them on for? I can\\'t believe your teeth shifted back that badly. Now I\\'m worried that any progress I\\'ve made isn\\'t going to last.Ive had braces twice (both only about 8-9 months) and Invisalign in conjunction with the last lot. The last time was 7 years ago. I was meant to get jaw surgery but chickened out. However, my top jaw went back to being narrow again, and my open and overbite are causing a lot of issues now so Im looking into it again. My teeth are still pretty straight (bottom ones moved back because I lost my retainer), but its about my bite. \\n\\nHere  https://imgur.com/a/[these are my jaw pics ](https://imgur.com/a/u49arSp) \\n\\nI have a fixed retainer on my top teeth and wear my retainer every second night and my top teeth are still straight.

Invisalign is a nice option because it is removable which was a major selling point for me. If I could have done it over again I would have just gotten regular braces. I had a lot of crowding in the bottom. My ortho was pretty aggressive with ipr (shaving teeth to make space). There are certain areas where its now a trap for food because he was too aggressive with it. I did weekly changes so  my teeth were sore for 2 days every week instead of just once a month for your tightening. You have to brush & floss after every meal or snack before you put the liners back on. I found myself eating more of a softer diet while I was in treatment because I felt like my teeth always hurt. I also realized what a snacker I was because I felt like I starved the first month- it was too much of a hassle getting the trays on/off at the beginning. BUT with all the things that bothered me I have a great result! Which in the end is totally worth it. Your teeth look way better than mine. They got pretty much back to my pre-braces state. So it was probably tougher for me than most. If the ortho recommended Invisalign its probably the best option for you.

Moving all my teeth around my two implants (top incisors) was a pain, but finally got it right. Also got a veneer mid treatment on little bottom tooth. So glad it's over. My anxiety was through the roof the whole time, I think I aged 10 years lol.Amazing how bite issues take longer ... beautiful results.They sure do. Thank you!Beautiful!  Truly.Thank you very much Did you have a bottom front tooth extractions, OP?I was also born without one of my bottom teeth as well, so they pushed them together when I had braces as a youngster.I had an extraction because of over crowding, and was worried how it would turn out. Your results give me hope.Gorgeous! Congrats!So beautiful!LoveLooks absolutely perfectThank you ºAmazing!Beautiful teeth!!\\n Are most treatments ~2 years? I understand everyone is different but I worry.. my dentist set my treatment to 1 year.Mine will be 28 trays/one week changes; seven months total. Assuming Ill be getting refinements, so probably about a year total. It seems like thats a pretty standard timeframe.Wow!Thank you ºLooks great. I have implants in the same places and definitely get anxious from time to time about my crowns with the traysThank you. Were you just born without the adult teeth?Yeah. It was so embarrassing growing up without them and I smile really big. I waited for a long time to get implants because I was scared of dental surgery after a bad experience having my wisdom teeth removed as a kid. So I had temporary bridges and after the last failed I broke down and got implants. Ive never been more confident in my smile. \\n\\nIm just doing some minor movement of bottom teeth and realigning some of the top teeth.I'm so happy for you! I was put into braces from 6th grade to 11th grade to make space. Then implants at 17.I'm glad I got them done as a youngster because I'm way more of a baby now lol. But definitely embarrassing until I got my fake teeth put on my braces. It was a bit scary during treatment as my teeth got pushed up, the top of my implants (abutments) started to show, but thank goodness they are normal againI think I asked the orthodontist more questions about the impact the trays would have on the implants and crowns than about the treatment process haha. \\n\\nI had braces as a kid too to make room for the fake teeth and it was just so embarrassing. And then with choosing temporary bridges and such for so long I still have very real visceral reactions when I see people saying to use polident or another denture cleaner to clean the trays - I immediately become embarrassed about not never having those teeth naturally. \\n\\nI think I would have freaked out if my abutments showed through after getting the trays. Im glad to hear that theyre back to normal.Great smile.Thnk uGorgeous! What is your lipstick?!Thnx! Buxom lip plumping glossWow, theyre perfect, congrats!BeeeeyutifulDid you get bonding done in the front right tooth?The top?YeahNope just random shaped teethYeah your teeth looked really good. \\n\\nIn the pic before invisalign, it looks like a front upper tooth is slightly longer than the other one. I'm on tray 20ish/ 40 so halfway there and I have the same in my upper tooth. I'm not sure if it will fix itself with the rest of the trays or if its something I should ask about in the refinement stage, as I want to do whitening before any potential bonding so that it may match the color. Not sure if its bonding, shaving, or tooth reshaping that would fix it tbh.Hi I also have a deep bite and I was told I couldnt change it without jaw surgery. Did you get any appliances to help move your bite? Has your facial profile changed?No appliances or surgery.

What if I only have time to brush my teeth in either morning or evening and cant in between?So I've got my crown and root canal done and now my dentist is recommending me to see an orthodontist to get my teeth straight again. Thing is, I used to have braces before as a teenager which was like 20 years ago, but I lost my retainers about a decade ago.

I can only do it twice a day (morning and evening after meals), but cant during lunch. So does that mean I cant get Invisalign?If you dont want to go through the process, then you dont have to.  I would never trust a dentist who suggested cosmetic orthodontics unless I asked first. I view this as inappropriate.(I may be misunderstanding what you said in this regard though.)\\n\\nHaving said that, I only floss once a day. I brush after meals, but only if Im home. If Im out I just swish with water and put the trays back in. I havent had any problems at all. \\n\\nIn my opinion, Invisalign isnt nearly as high maintece as this sub would have you believe.agree with this - this sub makes it seem like if you dont brush and floss every five minutes your teeth will fall out which is so not true. my orthodontist even said you only have to brush morning and might not in between. when I go out for the night with friends I also drink clear liquor cocktails with the trays in which I know most people would think is the worst thing in the world but you learn to adjust to what works for you.You can get invisalign if you want to. You still have to go in periodically the check everything is moving okay but not that often. I went for checkups about every 10 weeks. I would keep mine in until well after my morning coffee, and then eventually brush and it was fine. I only brushed after meals during the day and flossed once a day at night.

Wishing you a smooth treatment and beautiful results!Thank you \\x9dï¸\\x8fI\\'m 54 weeks in and I think about trying to switch to braces all the time. It really feels like my bite is just becoming infinitely more jacked up with each passing week while the ONE crooked tooth I started this for is barely improved.Omg same here. Just do it. Switch to braces. After 100 trays of Invisalign my teeth are even more messed up. They align my teeth, mess my bite up then attempt to fix my bite and end up misaligning my teeth, over and over. \\n\\nI got a second opinion and the doctor told me aligners is a poor choice on my providers behalf (they had ordered my third refinement round). \\n\\nIf I could go back in time when I first started in 2019, I would have started with braces. I woulda been done over a year ago but alas, I had my provider put braces on \\n\\nJust switch to braces for your sanitys sakeOf you just stick with it your bite will change because of wear anyway just like when I first had traditional braces.Sorry what do you mean your bite is getting jacked up?!When I have my aligners out the only teeth that touch naturally are one incisor on the top and one on the bottom. If I want to chew food I have to really carefully stick my jaw out to the side like a llama chewing cud. Even then I can\\'t chew anything up well because my molars can\\'t fully touch.\\nIf I forget at all I accidentally crack my front teeth together painfully and it feels like they might chip at this rate. I know stuff has to temporarily get worse to get better, but I\\'ve been dealing with this for over 8 weeks. \\n\\nWhen I started treatment, I had zero effort eating and had one lower incisor crooked from crowding. Ortho informed me I had a mild overbite.I have that exact same issue.Lots of people will say, wait 2 weeks, and I agree to some degree. \\n\\nIm 4 weeks in and the moral of the story is that you eventually adapt to the lifestyle HOWEVER I definitely have moments where Im like regretting not doing traditional. Lifes too short to be miserable thats for sure so glad you were realistic with yourself and switched while it was early enough. Best of luck.Thank you :)15 months with Invisalign and teeth are straight but now I have bite issues that refinements aren\\'t fixing so heading the traditional way.Did your orthodontist approve your change? Hope it goes well for you!!!Read my comment from above. Might help solidify your decisionI did 9 months of Invisalign then opted to switch to traditional braces. Not being able to eat frequently was causing me blood sugar issues, so they waived the $500 fee to switch. I also find traditional braces significantly less painful, even after 9 months of Invisalign. I needed dental wax all the time with the Invisalign, and havent needed it once with traditional braces. Yes, they hurt more for about 2-3 days but then the pain is gone until I get them tightened again 6 weeks later, rather than having 1-2 days of discomfort or pain every single week.That fee is sad the orthodontists we work with never charge a difference between Invisalign and traditional braces. Ortho is ortho.Ive being thinking about switching to metal braces. Seeing this made me hopeful theyll let me without charging me or getting mad‚ Im going to call tomorrow! Fingies crossed°\\x8f¼Let me know how it goes!! Honestly I think its so easy for them to switch you. I think in some ways orthos prefer traditional braces. If you think about it, it didnt cost them anything to get you the trays. No harm in asking. How far are you into your treatment?Yes I hope youre right! Im on tray 10 right now. I was wearing them each for two weeks but my bite is not moving fast enough so Im wearing them for 1month until my bite is fixed ´. I always keep my rubber bands on when I have my trays in, just sometimes I leave them out for a little too long.. Im just over the whole taking them in & out just to eat. Ill let you know how it goes°Just want to share my short experience in case someone is like me and didnt like Invisalign or is on the fence about which way to go. I was only a part of the club for 2 days lmao I admire yalls strength. Details: I had Invisalign for 2 days and was like œhellll no, I cant do this\\x9d. Thankfully my orthodontist didnt charge me to switch but he probably thinks Im dramatic ‚. Im so much happier with the metal. I had traditional braces 10 years ago so I knew what to expect to get them back on. Ill tell you, Invisalign was so different for me compared to my experience years ago. The pain, the pressure, stressing about when to eat, etc. It is a lot more work. \\n\\nThe first few days of Invisalign I cried. Lol. I didnt mind the pain (I mean I did. It was hell its a different kind of pain than I had with braces years ago) it was even more so a pain in the ass. In my line of work as a sign language interpreter, I do a lot of speaking when interpreting, and I was so self conscious with how I looked and sounded. ‚. Not only that, I just felt like the inconvenience getting the trays in and out was just a nightmare for my lifestyle. I know some people love Invisalign, but it just wasnt for me I guess. I never thought Id be so happy to get metal on my teeth  \\n\\nEdit: I should have done more research and asked questions before signing the contract. I didnt realize how many attachments I would have, that I would need bands with them (if I knew that from the start I wouldve done traditional), that refinements are common, that you can see the attachments too, especially with the trays in. Just lots of stuff I didnt expect. Totally my fault to not research.I think you should have given it two weeks, not two days.\\n\\nThe first week was rough. The first tray was hard to talk with. The first tray hurt.\\n\\nThe second tray hurt way less. The second tray was easier to talk with. \\n\\nYes, it was an adjustment, but you get used to it.I dont think it would have made a difference for me personally because I didnt like how they looked on me :)From mostly unnoticeable to extremely obvious, well okay then. As a plus ppl will probably think you are younger!·\\x8f½\\x8dï¸\\x8f idk just my preference to have apparent braces than the look of the trays and attachments. I didnt realize how apparent it would look on me. I dont think its that way for everyone but it was for me.\\n\\nTo me, Invisalign is more like: *deeply stares at mouth as Im talking ” thinks to self:* œwhat heck is on their teeth?\\x9d \\n\\n\\nwhereas metal is like œah. Ok. Braces\\x9d *processed and moved on* \\n\\nOr at least thats my experience seeing people with Invisalign and the few days I had it interacting with a lot of people with my work. I had a little kid I worked with ask me œwhats wrong with your teeth?!\\x9d ‚ \\xa0ï¸\\x8f roasted by a first grader. The adults I worked with just stared at my mouth which felt worse hahaThe people staring at your mouth! Happened to me too. A lot. I almost felt a need to explain and just get it over with so we could move on with the convo lol.Omg it made me so uncomfyyyyyySeems like this is an unpopular opinion since you\\'re getting downvoted lol„ but I totally agree with you!! I haaate the look of Invisalign and I feel like people on here make it to be more invisible than it is? Or maybe it depends on the person, how much they naturally show teeth while talking/smiling, where their attachments are... But on me it\\'s so noticeable and I also hate having people staring at my teeth wondering why they look like that lol. I hate the shiny look of the plastic too. For me the good thing about Invisalign is it actually comes off lol so I do occasionally for events or whatever. But I totally understand your point of view.Thanks! Yeah I have no idea why people are downvoting that ‚ for me it was so noticeable and looked extremely awkward. I hated it. It made my teeth look kinda dinghy too. I think it was the plastic, like you said. It just has a weird, foreign look that people cant seem to sort out unless they know about Invisalign.TBH I\\'m surprised that anyone would care what others think. It is my health, the thought of other people opinions never crossed my mind. BTW after initial discomfort trays are so much comfortable than braces and cleaning teeth is so easy in comparison with braces.Good for you then :) I do care how people perceive me. Just how I am.I hear you! If I had a job with a lot of talking I would hate Invisalign! Im at the end of my 14 week treatment and I still get lispy and a bad dry mouth talking at work!! \\n\\nAlso dont beat yourself up too much about not doing research. Seems like a lot of providers are super uncommunicative and a lot of people are surprised by A LOT of things! Good luck with your braces :)No offense but the braces look objectively much worse, but as long as youre happy.No offense taken but I would say its not objective. The trays look kinda gross to me personally. I think metal looks better *on me*. Its very subjective :) not objective.If you have to predace it with no offense, maybe don\\'t share your thoughts? Just an opinion.no offense, but is postfacing a comment with \"just an opinion\" any better than prefacing one with \"no offense\"?I think so, when you look at the context. Commenting on a post by saying something looks worse, objectively (which it can\\'t be, it\\'s an opinion) is pretty rude. I was basically trying to say \"if you don\\'t have anything nice to say, don\\'t say anything at all.\" Which, to your point, is barely even an opinion, it\\'s basically common decency. But we don\\'t really need to get caught up in the semantics. \\n\\nI understand Reddit is toxic as a whole but I thought this sub would be somewhat uplifting for some reason. Obviously incorrect!I was being cheeky but yeah you\\'re absolutely correct in that the other guy was rude to say something looks objectively worse.Idk. As the other person mentioned, I dont want to get into semantics lol  its not that deep.Just being honest. I meant no offense, but I wanted to convey a potentially uncomfortable truth.It\\'s not really a truth if it\\'s your opinion.I mean, its by far the most important reason Invisalign was invented. Ive never once in my entire life heard someone utter the phrase œyou look so good with a mouth full of metal\\x9d!Nor have they said œyou look so good with a mouth full of plastic and teeth pimples\\x9d. Neither is ideal. Like lets chill and not argue over it. Its merely my *subjective* experience that I wanted to share lol ‚ lets take deep breaths and realize all just a matter of opinion. Sorry you seemed to have gotten worked up over my mouth lolHaha, well thats kind of the point with Invisalign. Nobody would say that because its not very noticeable in most circumstances which I believe most people would prefer.Thank you for sharing your experience! I think its hard to know what to look for when you dont know what you dont know. I wish doctors in US (assuming youre in US) would do a better job giving patients all the information they need.Yes, Im in the US! I totally fell for the marketing and œits soooo easy\\x9d aspect of it without doing my due diligence. Sometimes I just get excited and go for it, taking peoples word for whatever it is.You did the right choice. Traditional braces definitely make life easier, such as meal times and going out with friends/family to eat/drink.

Ultimately, it boils down to your preferences. If you feel you look better, are less self conscious, and it\\'s easier on you then you made the right choice. Good luck on your teeth!Definitely think it was smart to know your limits.  If you tried to force it you\\'d probably end up being bad with wear time and such which would make it worse in the long run.I feel you.

Glad you were able to switch without ficial penalty to something that works better for your lifestyle.Thanks!!Ill have been in trays for 4 years as of middle of June Im on set 6 I think of refinementsWhat the heck.Are you serious ³\\x90Why?Oh my gosh ¯Thank you for sharing your experience!\\nIt really helps to read about different cases and what works for each of us.\\n\\nBefore starting this process I was wondering what option should I take and couldn\\'t find any testimonies that swapped from one to another.Thanks :) yeah, I wanted to share a different side that some people might not see much. To show every one and every case is different.My orthodontist said a lot of people make this switch! As long as its right for you, thats what counts. I have SO much respect for this forum as Invisalign takes so much discipline IMO, especially if youve lots of trays.Curious what was the treatment length for your Invisalign vs now with braces?They estimated 18 months for Invisalign and were wishy-washy about an exact time. They gave me the 18 months number as a œjust in case of refinements\\x9d. \\n\\nTraditional 8 months to 1 year. :-)Dang so braces are faster. Thanks!I think it depends but the tech told me that even though I had 9 months of trays, they have to tell me 18 months because there are usually refinements to go through. She said they want to prevent people being mad when they dont finish at the time frame they expected. Which from what Ive read here is pretty common. I was told that with traditional braces, theres not as much guess work and they can manipulate the teeth easier.Got it! Thanks!Mine is longer because a molar wont respond to the plastic „ it depends on your treatment but in my case traditional would have been faster. I have my next appointment in June. Definitely gonna inquire about the switch because I just want to be done. Im almost two years in.SAME HERE!! I got mine placed a week agoYou got Invisalign a week ago?Traditional. I had Invisalign for 2.5 years prior to traditional thoughI dont know if its an option for me but tbh I def would have done traditional if I knew how annoying it would beI did that yesterday too and I am in so much pain ¢.  Invisalign gave me a deep bite that I previously never had and I am so unhappy about that.Im starting to feel like you and I havent even started Invisalign. I have anxiety already. I think braces might make more senseInvisalign is SO much better than braces. I had braces for 8 years as a kid/teen and my gums were always hurting from the brackets rubbing against them. I had to use dental wax all the time, which was annoying af. There were tons of foods I could just never eat (popcorn, most gummies/taffies, corn on the cob, even apples and many others). I have permanent marks on my teeth from calcium deposits where my brackets were. Occasionally wires snapped and I had to rush to my orthodontist. Braces were miserable the whole time I had them. \\n\\nInvisalign was rough getting used to it for about the first week, until the attachments wore down a bit and I got used to the feeling of something around my teeth. Its not that hard to manage. You can take them out pretty much whenever you want as long as its less than 4 hours total per day. Thats like 3 meals and a whole two hours to snack if you want. And you dont have to brush your teeth every time you put them back in, you can just rinse your mouth out with water. Also literally no one has noticed that I have them in unless I tell them.I am on day 3 only of my journey with Invisalign. So far, no pain at all. I was very nervous to begin with. Not sure if Ill get pain once the attachments are added next month, but so far Im happy. My daughter had traditional braces about 10 years ago, and I saw the pain, ulcers etc she had to put up with. Good luck, whatever you decide.Getting Invisalign or traditional braces is an individual choice but personally, I do not regret that I went the Invisalign route rather than traditional braces. Yes, it is annoying to take my Invisalign off to eat, but on the bright side, I have stopped snacking 10 times a day and lost 5 pounds in a month. I meet new people all the time at work and would have conversations for hours and not one person would realize that I have Invisalign. It is only when people offer me food or we go out to eat that I causally bring up my Invisalign. As far as getting used to talking \"normally,\" I had a slight lisp for about a week or two and it all went away. Now I don\\'t even realize have Invisalign on most of the time. Best decision ever.I really think you have to try sometimes to know for sure if it will work for you.

You will always need to carry around a toothbrush, floss etc.\\n\\nOverall Invisalign is great but is not without its inconveniences.\\n\\nI've never had traditional braces but from what I understand there are some food limitations but you can eat/drink whenever you want, don't need to worry about being compliant with wear time as they are fixe, then there's the obvious downside of high visibility.\\n\\nUltimately a year isn't a long time, but that would be a year of trays, you would then have 3-6 months of wearing the retainer full-time them gradually reducing, you could also need refinements which can sometimes be as long if not longer than the original treatment.As someone whos done both braces and Invisalign, braces is 30x more annoying and painful to have so I would definitely recommend Invisalign if the treatment plan is around a year.thanks so much, I dont mind doing invaslign or braces im just struct between the two because i want my teeth to be perfectly straight but if i wanna do that id have to get a tooth extracted (pre molar). The dentist assistant keeps persuading me that the smile will last a life time with braces and an extraction, vs invaslign which I would have a nice smile with the overbite.Hey can I ask what content strategy youve had a girl or should I add them all to my aromantic bois!)\\n\\nWere all deluxe sample sizes and mostly if not all stattracking site show that.\\n\\nThat type of error is so easy now that Id mix it up and its getting hard to adjust the settings?I've had both and wud choose Invisalign as wellMy way of looking at it is that braces are noticeable yes but theyre clearly an orthodontic appliance. Invisalign is slightly less noticeable but your attachments can get very yellow and your teeth just look slobbery? And dirty? Idk if youre not bothered then braces might be the way to go and you would be in the hands of a professional all the time instead of changing trays on your own.Are you doing this for cosmetic reasons?\", 'labels': ['oral hygiene', 'self-consciousness', 'tray time management', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'facial appearance', 'financial concerns', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns'], 'scores': [0.24471481144428253, 0.22981590032577515, 0.17704981565475464, 0.12394029647111893, 0.10338380932807922, 0.06176011264324188, 0.059335242956876755]}, {'sequence': 'This is not what I thoughtCommercials make invisalign seem so easy.

If your tray edges are sharp, you can take a nail file and use it to smooth the edges out, leaving dental wax for the ones that are still uncomfortable after that. \\n\\nIt will get better! You will adjust to all of this, I promise.I felt the same way on my first tray. I was like, dude at least could drink wine and eat snacks with braces.\\n\\nBUT. You get used to it. I swear.

My ortho recommended this and it was night and day.I had a lot of trouble with that in the beginning. on my first round of trays I had a small bit on one side that I had to snip off with nail scissors. I used wax a bit in the beginning but soon abandoned that. things settled down in the first few weeks and everything didnt feel as sharp or uncomfortable100000% Agree \\n´‘¬µ\\xad\\x90ï¸\\x8fWe all had this same feeling. Every single one of us.  In the first or second week, you think about just writing off the money and quitting.\\n\\nKeep going. Push through the first two weeks and it really does get pretty easy.  It\\'s always going to be a little inconvenient, but it\\'ll never again be like the first couple weeks.  And it\\'s worth it.OMG THIS. I recall being in the chair at the dental office, getting an attachment replaced that fell off, texting my boyfriend saying I don\\'t care about the money, I\\'m out. I want them off, I change my mind and writing off the $5k. I wasn\\'t even a month in and totally regretted it. It\\'s a little over a year later, I am at the end of my treatment and start retainers for 3 mos starting in June and then I\\'m done. I\\'m so so glad I stuck with it and my boyfriend talked me out of quitting.Im sorry your ortho didnt fully prepare you for Invisalign. Ive just finished mine and honestly if I could go back Id do it again 100% no thinking time needed. Give it a few weeks and it will all start to feel normal. Hang in there!ThanksYoure on the really tough stage. Honestly they dont hurt at all after a while. The attachments get worn down too so they dont feel noticeable then.The attachments are so sharp at first but yes, they get more dull over time.I\\'m on tray 5 of 17 and it\\'s soo much better once you get past the second tray. I was all torn up and uncomfortable for the first week, then again when I switched to the next tray. After that I just had very mild discomfort with switching for just a day. My main issue is compliance with wear time honestlyMy braces were so much worse for me in terms of space and how much they cut up my cheeks, personally. I had 1 or 2 trays of invisalign that caused some cuts along my cheeks/gums so I filed them down and healed fine after that.After a while it\\'s fine. It just becomes annoying not being able to eat whenever you want without having to take them out.Ive lost weight because I cant snack like I used to. Theyre a blessing in that respect.Thats EXACTLY, word for word, how my first week was! I was going through half a pack of ortho wax a day, my tongue was shredded up and swollen, and I had to fight with my aligners to get them off. I regretted getting Invisalign so much, I started panicking at the thought that I would feel like that throughout my whole treatment. I dont know what it is about that first week of aligners being so sharp, but it seems like a common thing. Week two was immediately better. Im on week 9 now and forget I even have them in, I actually prefer having them in versus out! Hang in there, the first week is awful but its smooth sailing after that. :)I prefer them in than out now too, and I am only one week in. My teeth feel so little and paper thin without aligners in!They literally feel like theyre made of glass!thanks...that\\'s so reassuringI agree. I mean it\\'s 6 of one half a dozen of the other though.\\n\\nYou CAN take them out to eat - which is great. But you HAVE to take them out to eat. Yes, you have to wear them 20-24 hours, but you can take them off for 2-4 hours a day. They are killing you? Take them off and eat/drink - feel okay, then clean them and put them back in.\\n\\nWith braces, you can eat whenever you want! Nothing to do beforehand. But you can\\'t ever remove them at all. They killing you? Too bad. Oh and you have to be far more careful what you eat, because you can\\'t take them off to eat. When you eat, food gets stuck in them far worse than just attachments.\\n\\nI\\'ve had braces, it\\'s better (with invisalign). It\\'s a lifestyle adjustment, but it\\'s still better.Thanks...and great points!!ive had invisalign for 7 months and literally had 0 pain or any cutsI\\'m 4 months in and had zero issues with cuts/ulcers too. I wonder what\\'s wrong with these people\\'s trays as I\\'ve heard it\\'s common. Something isn\\'t rightIm only on my second tray but same here, zero cuts and only what Id describe as mild discomfort of the tooth that is being moved the most.  Its awful that some people are experiencing additional & unnecessary discomfort or pain.Same. Im on refinements and I havent had any ulcers, cuts, or major pain.Same Im only 2 months in and no issues with the trays hurting my mouth\\n\\nTheres teeth pain the first few days with a new tray but thats to be expected while the teeth move\\n\\nBut no issues with the trays rubbing inside my mouth.So I\\'ve had periods of treatment with attachments and/or elastics and periods without. I notice way more pain with attachments, especially when I had them on almost every tooth plus elastics (which I absolutely refused to wear after a while and so we just rescanned without this option because otherwise I\\'d have quit for sure).\\n\\nI think that\\'s partly because the hooks for the elastics really jag into your mouth even if they slightly bend to the side. And then even when there was no elastics and fewer attachments, it was still worse because the attachments made them harder to remove which I think led to sharper edges because of how the motion of moving them makes them stick out a little.\\n\\nOh, and as for ulcers - I had them throughout and it\\'s agony. My dentist says it\\'s because I\\'m on medication, and she\\'s probably right. My mouth can get really dry at the best of times, then add these things in and it\\'s hell. The reason my treatment time has been so long with so many rescans is because I literally couldn\\'t handle the pain and wore them way less than I should have. Like I literally didn\\'t wear them at all pretty much for a while. I\\'m okay with that though, I\\'d rather it be spread out more and not have wanted to die in the process! \\n\\nNo regrets, my teeth look amazing, but it\\'s definitely not been easy. You get used to it in terms of some of the elements, but personally I didn\\'t in terms of others. Saying that, I was given the option of stopping as I was like 95% perfect, but I still wanted the chance to get to 100% so I guess it wasn\\'t that bad (I\\'m still happy I got to compromise though, even though removing elastics meant my bite may not be quite 100% I literally couldn\\'t care less).I wonder the same. I wonder if its also their dentist or ortho not doing a thorough enough job scanning their teeth, and therefore the trays cutting them.. the first week my tray fit a little weird that it scratched me a bit but quickly ended.Same although Im only 3 weeks in theres no cuts or sharpness whatsoeverI had to file down a place on the edge of my 1st and second tray becasue it was pushing up my gum. I also have two buttons and a power chain on the inside of my teeth which bugs my tongue sometimes, but neither of those are problems for me whatsoever. It\\'s surprising to hear people talk about cuts and pain from the trays.Same. I mean some trays are tighter than others but nothing that didn\\'t subside in a day.Its the rubber bands that cause my cheeks to become cut up and sore. I also wash my mouth out regularly with clear mouthwash (the blue of green stuff stains the trays) and that irritates the inside of my cheeks. I drink coffee with my trays in sometimes and the mouthwash helps me be able to have a drink without taking out my trays and still maintain a clean mouth.Honestly, try not to worry. I felt like that too at the start, but it really does become barely noticeable soon enough. Im on 13/20 and i think the only frustrating part is taking them out to eat and even that isnt too bad. Youll get used to it.I spent the first couple of days almost in tears but it really does get better. It\\'s totally normal to me now. (I\\'m on 8/20.)The first tray was pretty bad for me. It gets waaay better.[deleted]I had ceramic braces years ago - I didnt mind themI saw you\\'ve already done some filing on your trays to help with the sharp edges, but salt water rinses will help with the cuts/sores on the inside of your mouth!! It\\'ll soothe and help with healing too. The first week is always the roughest, but once your attachments kinda wear down and round out a little it\\'ll be much easier to pop your trays out. As for benefits, the biggest advantage I\\'ve experienced is that I can perform my dental hygene so much easier than if I had regular braces. The idea of having to floss around those wires just seems like such a colossal pain in the ass.\\n\\nHang in there though! We all swear it gets better/easier!That\\'s good to know about the attachments smoothing out - I can feel them poking through the aligners and they are sharp when I take them off to eat.Yes to the filing and salt water! FWIW, I find that the non-iodized salt tastes better than iodized. Both are super cheap. Best of luck!!Yeah, I feel they gloss over the negative parts. Others say it does get easier but I think traditional braces would be easier in terms of eating and drinking which is actually a huge painI did the whole series and a whole series of refinements and honestly if I had it to do over, I would have gone for traditional metal braces.  It would have been a shorter process, been monitored more closely by an ortho who could make on-demand adjustments depending on progress, and been less work for me.I feel like I have so much more in my mouth than I would have with braces. And no comfortable place to put my tongueYou\\'ll get used to it.It will soon be what you thought. It\\'s just initial discomfort that will pass.Relax, one week in and you will stop noticing those things or will subside.\\n\\nFirst few days of Invisalign are interesting so youre not aloneIm on tray 7 of 16, I hated the first two weeks but it honestly does get better. I actually feel more comfortable with them in than I do with them out.The first tray is the worst and very difficult to get through but I promise it gets better. Im on 12/24 should be done by octoberAhh, the first two weeks. The first week I also didn\\'t think it was worth it, I was barely eating and it was making me grumpy. I had two extractions so I had to keep going and I was just thinking, \"OMG what have I done! What did I get myself into\", but I found my own routine a few weeks in. Keep going! It will get better!\\n\\nExcept the soreness lol there will probably be soreness the first few days you switch trays. I have worn some aligners longer than needed just to get some peace from the pain, idc if my treatment takes longer, I just don\\'t want to be miserable with constant soreness.It\\'s only worth it when it\\'s over lol. I\\'m looking into bonding to close my gap, because I can\\'t do two years of this. I\\'d go insane.Funny - I can deal with soreness from the teeth moving - its all the sharp edges and sores/cutsAhh I can\\'t, the pain isn\\'t bad, but the soreness is just constant that it irritates me and ends up giving me a headache – I think I only had one set of trays that were sharp in the back and I filed that piece down lol thankfully haven\\'t had anymoreI thought I was going to die the first week. Im on week two now and I dont even feel the trays in the mouth. The attachments dont cut my mouth anymore either with my trays out. I only have mine out less than 2 hours a day though. It does get better. Stick with it.thanksYeah. Id say it gets better- and it does- but then it gets worse again (as you get even more sick of it). \\nIn retrospect I would have done braces. \\nAnd yeah- the brackets, Invisalign my ass. They lie so much.Everybody says 1 or 2. I say give yourself 6 weeks. It\\'s hard to talk,  attachments are a lot more than you realize. It hurts constantly. Eating is awful for a while. Cleaning them etc. But it does get better and u think 6 weeks is the right time to fully be used to what\\'s happening.After the first tray, you don\\'t experience that anymore. But if it\\'s truly unbearable, talk to your orthodontist about filing down some of the edges that are bothering you!I was exactly where you are! Somewhere there is my first post that is so much like yours. However, I\\'m over 4 months in and hardly feel them most of the time. Dental wax is your friend when you\\'re trying to eat. Put it over the aligners and enjoy your food ¡I\\'ve been through traditional braces AND am currently near the tail-end of Invisalign treatment.\\n\\nInvisalign has been so much better, especially when it comes to keeping the teeth clean.Yes I felt the same way! It gets better I still havent figured out what causes the tray to cut my tongue yet! I tried wax but youre right too bulky.So i dont have Invisalign, i have a similar tray system but my ortho uses the brand 3M and i have to say, the trays are always smooth and Ive never had an issue with cuts in my mouth. \\n\\nThat being said, I used to struggle so much getting the trays out. The straighter my teeth have gotten, the easier it is to get trays out.Give it 2 weeks, I barely feel mine now.Hang in there, we all felt the same way! Take a nail file to your trays, itll smooth them out. By 2 weeks youll be fine, Im on tray 6 now!Chill it ll be better from 3rd set onwards. Im on my 30+ set. I forget im wearing oneI can tell you I felt the same way until maybe tray 8!!!! It sucks, its hard, I hated it but I just hung in there. Others will make you see its worth it. You do get used to it. Hang in there. It will get easier. I was devastated. It is okay now but takes a few mo to get used to! Hang in there you got this!I felt the same way the first week. Like.. wtf did I do. Now as Im writing this- I cant tell I have them on unless I feel them with my tongue. You get used to them1/35 is miserable for everyone. Come back when youre halfwayI hear you. The first 3-4 days of the first week were THEE WORST! I also thought maybe I made the wrong decision but Ive been wanting Invisalign for years! Me reminding myself how blessed I am to finally get to this point made me push through the first week of pain.\\n\\nOn tray 12 now and I havent had any pain since my tray 4. Tray 2-3 were ok then tray four hit me with the tight pain. But havent had any pain since. Taking Tylenol during the days I couldnt take the pain and switch your trays the night before youre supposed to switch trays was the best advice Ive read. \\n\\nHang in there! Itll be worth it :)I felt the same for the first few days, everything heals and things get much easier once your mouth adjustsI, too, hated my first week. \\nIt was trash.\\nYour mouth adjusts.First couple days I was feeling kind of similar to this minus the cuts lol everything is going much smoother now although it is very annoying because I like to snack on things randomly. I try to look at the positive side of things, I will prob not eat fast food nearly as much on the go anymore. Hope it starts getting better for you!You paid a lot of money for the system - I would go back to your provider and ask them to file the trays down.Idk when I had braces the wires would slide out occasionally and go through my cheek, my braces cut up my mouth so badly and Invisalign has not hurt nearly as bad as getting wires tightened, Bands and chains and springs put in with braces  it definitely gets better and it moves quick!!im on tray 13 of 35 and i forget i have them in. lisp is the worst the day after the new tray goes in but my friends think it\\'s charming and that\\'s all that matter!Thats because youre on your 1st tray. Chill out.i felt the same way my first week or so. I was truly regretting spending all that money. I was in so much pain but it got wayy easier and rarely hurts like it use to. you adjust and it is less of a pain in the ass. then next thing you know, so much time has passed and you look back at old photos and see the difference. its exhilarating :)Like pretty much every comment has said, it gets so much easier. However, I completely agree that its not accurately advertised. Im happy now that Im maybe 1/3 way though my treatment, but I also wouldve been happy if everyone had been more honest. I dont think my ortho was trying to deceive me. I think that awful time is so short they dont want to make too big a deal about it. I still wouldve chosen Invisalign over something that didnt use attachments because this will have better results. I hope it gets better sooner rather than later for you!\\n\\nIf someone else hasnt said it yet, just as a heads up, it does get overall easier but I find that with each new tray I struggle a bit to remove them for the first day or two. Nothing like the very first week but dont get too discouraged if that happens to you toothank you[deleted]I didn\\'t think of that. So people with braces can\\'t floss? I guess they can use a water pick?They have to either use a water pick or threader flossYou really think that dentists and orthodontist would put braces on people for years that would not let them floss?\\n\\nYou just have to use a threader or special floss. It\\'s just a tad harder, requires a slight bit more effort.It baffles me how many people do no research before committing to this.Im on 8 of 32 and still not used to it. The people in here giving you positive advice is because they are done with it. Its like having a 2 year prison sentence, of course it wasnt so bad after you get out. Im sure Ill do the same when Im done. But as of now Im still going through psychological distress mostly from the process every time you eat and feeling like youre on a clock. And the worst is the changing of your bite where it feels like you dont know how to chew anymore. Anyways gl, totally worth it ;)You can get rid of the sharp edges with zero grit sandpaper. (i don\\'t really know what they called but it\\'s the least rough one).thanks - just ordered some small files on amazonThat will help a lot! Also, some trays have more shelves edges than others. So, hopefully, this is just a particularly bad onethat will definitely help. you can smooth the sharp edges and it will feel much betterHave any of you had white spots appear on your teeth? I\\'m on my second tray and today I noticed a small white spot on my lower front tooth. Is it demineralization? And if so is it reversible?No - i\\'m only on day 3Oh well keep me updated I guess ‘\\x8d\\x8f¼ (It\\'s been 10 days for me)Peroxyl can really help with mouth sores. It does get better.Yes! I was gonna mention this, I used peroxyl mouth wash at first to help my mouth healDid the not give you a little mail file? I was given one and told to use it to file down any sharp bits. Works really well.They didnt give it - but i just bought oneJust make sure its only used on your trays lolIve had mine for over a year now (doing refinements now) and Ive only ever had one pair of aligners cut me. I just filed it with a nail file and I was good to go. The first few weeks were the worst for me. I was almost in tears because I felt like I couldnt remove the aligners to eat, and those stupid attachments felt so foreign in my mouth. It does get easier and youll get used to them.I felt exactly the same, I promise it gets easier. I\\'ve had mine for over a year now and it\\'s second nature.\\nYou can also get a nail file and file down some of the rough edges. I had a few trays that were too long at the back and were clipping straight into my skin that is around my partially erupted wisdom teeth. I filed those bits away and it didn\\'t impact my progress and made such a difference.\\n\\nI hope it eases up for you soonThanks - did that with the file. You would think after all the $$$$  - they can develop trays that don\\'t have sharp edges.Im on tray 3 and I still feel a bit like you do.  Tray 1 was clear with no attachments (a œtraining\\x9d tray according to the dentist).  It was uncomfortable and tight, with nowhere to put my tongue.  Then Tray 2 came and I got attachments - aaarrgghhh - why dont they tell you about those?  I found out from watching YouTube videos.  I think I have 12 of them and I couldnt eat for the first 3 days because one of them was cutting my lip without the trays in.  I had to hold my bottom lip out away from the sharp attachment with one hand and feed myself with the other.  And getting them out was a nightmare, if I didnt have the tool hook thingy I wouldnt have been able to. I broke 2 fingernails before I got that. I went to the dentist on day 4 and she filed down the sharp attachments and trimmed the part of the tray that was digging in.  I also hate the attachments because theyre whiter than my teeth, so now Ive been given the whitening kit to use with the aligners, just until my teeth become the same colour as the attachments.  It was either that or have the attachments replaced with a colour more like my teeth.  There are 2 nodule things on the back of the top aligner beside my front teeth and my tongue is constantly rubbing on those.  Theyre something to do with fixing my bite, forgot to ask about more detail.  And what about all this excess saliva?  Im sucking the tray and swallowing saliva all the time.  I had ceramic braces 30 years ago and I remember having cut lips and cheeks, and when one one came loose (which was always on a weekend), it was swinging around the wire.  However, I could eat and drink whenever I wanted.  I dont know which Id choose if Id known 3 weeks ago what I know now.  But Im on the journey now and theres no going back.  I spent an hour this afternoon editing the attachments out of photos taken of me with my family on Mothers Day today.  If it wasnt for attachments, Id be a lot happier.  Most people have been saying its better after a week or two, so I guess its going to take a month or two for me.  Youre not the only one whos disappointed, and this is a great place to share your misery!Same problem with attachments - that I never knew existed! I just put wax on the attachments this morning - so I can eat without that rubbing pain. Last night I loaded my mouth with wax before bed - it helped my gums to calm down while I was sleeping. I hate that wax feeling during the day - my mouth feels so loaded with crap! When I had ceramic braces my mouth felt more \"free\"How are you feeling now? I will change to tray 4 tomorrow night and the last 3 days have been sooo much better than before. What everyone says must be true. Itll be 4 weeks tomorrow since I started and I now feel it will all be OK. I hope youre getting used to it but if not just wait a bit longer.Hi..thanks for asking. Thursday will be two weeks. Feeling much better! The mouth cuts and sores are gone. Still an adjustment with eating schedules, cleaning and getting them back in etc . Find myself clenching on them while I\\'m sleeping. \\n\\nI change to my next tray in two days then I\\'m on a weekly change schedule. \\n\\nThe Pull key definitely helpsYep, the eating schedule is probably the hardest part now. I havent mastered the art of removing them surreptitiously yet. Oh, and the Tray Minder app is good.You get used to it I promise!! Im on tray 6 and barely notice them in my mouth anymore and the difference I see already makes it worth it. Hang in there! You wont regret it once you start noticing changes.Thanks!!It definitely gets better. You probably should have done more research but I understand. It gets better.funny..I feel like I did research - except for Reddit - which is the only place really discussing the negatives. Should have come here first!Lol Reddit keeps it real!Definitely agree with what everyone else is saying and some great tips.

Definitely in my kiti've never even heard of those.When do you guys use mouthwash? After brushing?I use one that repairs enamel, so I use mouthwash after I brush and while I am using the mouthwash, I multi task and brush my aligners with the toothpaste left on my toothbrush.Yes! After brushing and before putting the aligners back in.I use mouthwash before brushing as my dentist said it's better to let some of the toothpaste residue stay on your teeth to prevent cavities. So floss, mouthwash, then brush.I would sometimes brush, then use mouthwash, then strategically add back some of my enamel repair toothpaste in problem areas before putting them back inAnd do you rinse after that with water or not?Nope! Spit but don't rinse, that can wash the toothpaste off. It takes a little getting used to, but it's worth it to reduce your risk of cavities.Good to knownice keyboard\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nall is a few of those wisps, it's not that big of a deal to me, i brush at homeare those red and white tools to help you remove your aligners cuz thats pretty smart i should get them lolSo the white one is a spatula that came with my wax. The pink one is my pul tool from Amazon! 5 dollars and honestly a life saver in publicInvisalign case.Case, floss, wisps, pull tool, chewies, tooth brush and tooth paste, and a mirror !Im confused by all those kits. I just pop them out, rinse, pop them back in. Brush my teeth whenever I come back home.What are the alcohol wipes for? other than cleaning your hands before you put them in your mouth?I have piercings and I keep them in my kit so when I get x rays at my check ups, I can clean my jewelry and my ears when I go to put them back in.Invisalign case, travel toothbrush, mini toothpaste, two cases of floss, and mini mouth wash.  I floss when I eat things like meat or leafy greens and the mouthwash after eating more pungent foods. Nothing worse than having your teeth marinate in essence of garlic pasta sauce.Those Wisps are a lifesaver aren't they?!?!Can you list what you have? Starting my journey in a few weeks and want to be prepared. I noted the alcohol wipes is a great idea. Didnt even think of that.I use the alcohol pads because I have a lot of piercings so when they take x rays I can take them out and clean them/my ears for the x rays Ž\\n\\nI keep xylitol mints, wisps, floss, toothbrush, toothpaste, wax, case, pul tool, hand sanitizer, chapstick, alcohol pads, and toothpicksi keep floss in my fanny pack sometimes. does that count?Toothpaste, toothbrush, floss picks, Invisalign case. Thinking I need to start carrying chapstick too because my lips have been really dry.Pocket with some floss and a toothbrush. I don't bother with paste for my kit as it's not needed mid Day.Very similar to yours! Floss, wisps, mini travel toothbrush & toothpaste, mouthwash, chapstick, Tylenol, case, and I do icebreakers Suger free mints. At the very beginning I also kept orajel in my kit due to pain from cuts, sores and the aligners movement themselves.Oh and the hand sanitizer of course!alligner case for going out, alligner cleaning case, floss, electric toothbrush, whitening mouth wash, steradent cleaning tablets :)Invisalign car and a travel toothbrush with toothpaste pre applied.Oof. Im considering getting Invisalign and posts like this make me want to run for the hills. Do you really need all of these things?You dont! Some people, when out, just pop them out, eat, rinse with water, try to chew a xylitol mint, pop them back in, brush at home (asap). \\n\\nIf it sounds like trouble, you might consider braces! If your teeth and gums are healthy, braces are a great option.Ive been debating that. Seems like it would be over faster too from what I can tellIts hard to say. In some case, braces can be faster & less expensive, but sometimes the opposite is true. \\n\\nI was super tempted to do braces so I wouldnt have to mess with trays, but ultimately, after researching, and even looking at medical papers on root resorption, gum health, etc, I decided on Invisalign for the health of my teeth and the ability to pop the aligners out and easily floss and clean my teeth. I know there will be times when I wish I had braces though!! \\n\\nWhatever you decide, I wish you the best!Thank you! Do you happen to remember where you saw info about root health?I dont, but if you get on DuckDuckGo and search root resorption Invisalign vs Braces, it should pull it up. I think there was a study by NIH, among others. :)Thank you!Youre welcome! If you have trouble finding some, let me know! ŠYou definitely don't need all this! I'm just a person who overprepares since I work so much.Good to knowDid you find the wisps at a store in person? I searched for them on Amazon and they are $17 for a pack. Is that what you paid?I bought a box of 4 packs from Amazon for 17. At the store they're around 5 dollars a pack here. Little pricey but they definitely come in handy.I just carry around a small reel of floss when i know im eating outWisps, floss, Invisalign case, chewy, mouthwash and mints and Carmex. \\n\\nI didnt think Id need one at first but quickly realized I was wrong lol. Definitely need to be ready after grabbing lunch on the go or going out for dinner.Toothbrush, toothpaste, dental picks, case, Ortho key, dry mouth mints, denture cleaning tablets. Sometimes mouthwash, and floss.Mini toothbrush with case, œflosscard\\x9d, essentially floss in a credit card, in my wallet, invisalign case, and toothpaste. I keep alcohol wipes and germ-x in my bag as well, but for a variety of reasons. I used to use the wisp sticks, but they didnt do much for me. I finished my 50 something Invisalign trays, but now wear a  Vivera retainer (by Invisalign) every day. I keep a retainer cleaner in my invisalign case as well.Nothing except my chewies to munch on when Im driving to work. \\nAlso, I dont eat during the day, that helps A LOT \\nI prefer to have my dinner and have them out for the 2 hours where I know I can brush and floss in peace. Work/Restaurant bathrooms have too much traffic for me to feel œclean\\x9dToothpaste, toothbrush, flosers, elastics, invisalign case, and hair tie.I have to have a mirror as just find it easier to remove/put back in the aligners when I can see what I'm doing.\\n\\nI bought a tiny round one and glued it to the inside lid of my invisalign case.\\n\\nAlso hand sanitizer as I don't like how much my fingers go in my mouth these days My first week I used so much dental wax, it was insane. Now, week 5, I have my elastics and case in my bag and thats pretty much it (thx for the reminder to buy more hand sanitizer!). At work I have a toothbrush and toothpaste. Unfortunately at work our lunch break is short. Ive discovered that its not enough time for me to eat and get a good deep clean, but I can get a brush in and clean trays.Nothing like this. I had the invisalign case with a chewie sitting in it, a folding toothbrush, a couple floss picks and that's it.I read that those Wisps have pork in them and Im a fan of bacon but it still sounded gross. Theyd be convenient as hell, but I cant get past the pork. \\xa0They may contain gelatin derived from pork. Like a ton of other products. Including many of toothpastes.

Now Ive two options create 5mm space through IPR which makes the tipping movement of the teeth and makes my lips better or extract 4 teeth and fix the protrusion entirely. Unable to decide the right option also unable to predict changes in face after extraction. I would like see before and after extraction profile changes how it impacted.This article has a lot of patient before and after photos.

Has your palate been measured and has an ENT checked whether your tongue can afford to lose space and be pushed back?   What did your orthodontist say your Intermolar Width is?  This is also key as after extractions, the palate also narrows.  39 mm is the minimum IMW for a man.My intermolar width will increase as per Clin check . My lower teeth will be retracted by 2mm and upper will be retracted by 4-5 mm and rest of the space molars will be pushed forward. Currently my dental arches are in V shape as per my doctor it will be changed to U shape. Ive 3mm overjet with proclined teeth. \\nYes tongue space is one of the thing Im worried too . As per my doctor as molars will be pushed forward it makes things better than worst. But I still feel ENT opinion is required to understand if my tongue can adjust with upper teeth pushed 5mm back .5 mm is a lot.   I will also xplain that I had extractions and now jaw surgeons are proposing double jaw surgery with 4-5 mm advance and I am dying for every mm.  My tongue is so squashed in my mouth I have speech problems, eating problems and breathing problems. \\n\\nThe exam I had with an ENT that clinched this issue is called a nasal fibroscopy.   A laser is put down your nose and videos the relationship of your tongue to your airway.  My video shows that my airway is completely blocked by my tongue.   Since my tongue can  no longer fit well it hangs down in the back.   Only way to get it to fit lengthwise normally would be  to advance the upper  jaw 5 mm surgically.  \\n\\nEven getting the extractions reversed will not work because the bone is no longer there where the teeth once were rooted.  Dental arches shrank  \\n\\nI have been searching for alternative surgeries to get the 5 mm advance to avoid double jaw surgery as it can numb out your lips permanently and takes a year to recover from.  Plus is super expensive.  \\n\\nNow every case is different.  You may have much larger jaws to begin with.  \\n\\nAlso makes sense that imw is increasing.  By making the u shape the front goes back and the sides get wider.  \\n\\nBy the way I suggest getting every detail of your treatment in writing including a promise  from your orthodontist that your tongue space will not be compromised.  This way if indeed there are issues later your orthodontist may be held responsible.  I am facing 50000 dollars out of pocket costs for my recovery --and double that if I need jaw surgery.  As you can guess I do not think it is right that I have to pay for this. . Was not disclosed how tongue space would be changed.Also if your molars are being pushed forward to close spaces this is smart and much better -0if it can be accomplished.  One guy I know was told his molars would be pushed forward but the roots are very hard to move and after three years the ortho gave Up.  This guy had it done at age  28.  now in his thirties and has reversed the extractions but u st for aesthetic reasons.  Did not like how his smile reduced and face changed. .   Had no prob he said with tongue space.one curious question: why is the plan going for 4-5 mm retraction if you are only 3 mm in overjet?   To make your proclined teeth straight?  it seems excessive retraction for a minor overjet.I would suggest a zoom with the world expert ENT on tongue space.

Thats the way my Ortho explained it as well.I got an estimate of 6 months for Invisalign but they warned me that at the end of that I would almost certainly need to be rescanned and then go through refinement trays too. \\n\\nWith braces I was told Id be completely finished in 6 months. \\n\\nI went with Invisalign because to me at 26 its worth it to have them be a little less noticeable than braces would be even if they take more time. \\n\\nI imagine Invisalign takes longer in many cases due to compliance. Braces- you cant really take them off and leave them off longer than youre supposed to. With Invisalign how well you follow the instructions plays a big part in how your treatment goes.I think if you have a good ortho, treatment times should be very similar..not saying you have a bad ortho but 1 year for one and 3 for the other seems very weird..I dont know the details or potential complications of your case but from my experience and my sons experience, both were options and both had similar treatment times, basically the same even. My case was also more complicated. Started with correcting my bite with bars, then Invisalign trays, wouldve been the same time with braces. If you are actually wearing your trays all the time except when eating, it should be little difference. Im including refinement tray times in my comparison of treatments as well. Maybe if you can get a second opinion thatd be helpful. Theyve made great strides in what they can do with Invisalign in recent years.Yes this is right. Braces are more precise and faster. Ive had braces and Invisalign …Id say his experience takes into account compliance. You can take/leave your Invisalign out - you cannot with braces. I think you have asked him to explain WHY they would take longer. But yeah - at least get one 2nd opinion.Ive had both braces and invisalign. Braces took SIX YEARS and invisalign (according to plan) will take 8 months. My teeth completely shifted back after braces since I didnt wear my retainer and now im my 20s im starting all over. Im happy it wont take as long as my braces didMy ortho said the opposite if youre compliant. With aligners you can apply forces on multiple tooth surfaces and you get tiny adjustments each week versus larger adjustments every 6-8 weeksThis is also what I've been told.I was told this as well. I thought braces would take shorter time and he said no. Also because one arch would have to be done before the other, while Invisalign does it at the same time.With braces there are no compliance issues - theyre either on or off. With Invisalign you just have to trust that the patient wears them daily for the allotted time and follows all protocols.It depends on the person. I have bite issues so after my initial 36 Im on 29 refinements with no visible improvements 6 trays in. I feel like my bite issues couldve been fixed much faster with braces, and Im almost inclined to ask for them if this round doesnt work. \\n\\nIf youre just trying to straighten teeth, then Invisalign should be around the same time or faster.My bite was corrected in the 1.5 years of Invisalign. Had a bad overbite.Well heres hoping. Currently 11 months in and my top teeth still completely overlap my bottoms when I smile.I would ask another ortho! These big differences mean hes pushing you towards his area of expertise. I will say however if I could do it again Id go with braces because its j\\nHarder to eff those up for both patient and practitioner and there is less shaving of teeth during removalI imagine everyone's situation is different, but I chose Invisalign because it was estimated to take 6 months faster than traditional braces and for the same cost.My ortho actually said the opposite. She told me if I were to go with traditional braces, it would be around two years but if I went with Invisalign, it would be less than a year.No need to consult again and again and again to different providers. Thats a neverending game of analysis paralysis!Found OP's ortho! \\nJuuust kidding. But although I agree with the above to some extent, I think in this case it may be worth it to do one more at least, since the difference in time quoted seems a little much.Yeah - true! Good point.Hard to say.  If I compare myself to a friend, you will see results much faster with me, even though my starting position was worse. She started in May last year and I started in February this year.  \\nI'm doing a refinement scan this week, but it already looks really good (compared to my starting point).  She is currently where I was in this summer in movments.  \\nI think it depends not only from case to case, but also from ortho to ortho.  \\nI would definitely go to a second consultation, if possible to a diamond provider.Its never hurts to get multiple quotes. As far as time difference I would think it depends on what exactly the issues are, but both orthos I consulted with said it would take the same amount of timeI think it probably varies with each patients needs. My ortho said Invisalign would be faster than braces for my case because I have a slight open bite. In his experience braces will obviously fix an open bite, but it makes it worse before it gets better which drags it out. Im sure another ortho may feel differently. It was interesting though. And Invisalign was cheaper at his office so that made my choice even easier lolI have been told by two different orthodontists that my treatment would be 12 months in aligners or 18 months in braces. The orthodontist Im working with said that we have to wait and see where we land after 12 months, it could potentially go longer. But the more I can stick to the program and keep them in 22 hours a day, the more likely well finish on time.At my ortho apparently regular braces were double the time as Invisalign. I finished Invisalign in 1.5 years where regular woulda taken 3. Who knows though honestly.

Truly, it's very manageable!!!\\n\\nPain wise, I was expecting to cry myself to sleep and to finish a bottle of Tylenol immediately after putting on my set of aligners. In reality, I had a very MILD discomfort over the aligners. The discomfort left after a day or two and I never had issues with eating. I have multiple attachments and they never cut into my mouth or anything like that (never used any dental wax either). I do not have elastics so I can't really advise that matter.\\n\\nMy most painful aligner was probably midway through my treatment and when I say painful, this is still mild like I can still eat and perform normal activities without thinking of the pain. \\n\\nWear time; I always get 20h in but if I go out like a party and whatnot, I'll take them out and that's it. \\n\\nI understand that people want to complain and get comforted, it's totally normal and human. It's also important to remember that when you read posts, we all have different experiences and it's easier to find complaints than happy and satisfied people. Take what you see with a grain of salt and go get that Invisalign!!The worst thing about it is the maintece. At worst its a bit inconvenient/just one more thing to deal with. Never found Invisalign to be that painful at all. Have elastics and they feel like nothing for me.Yeah it's incredibly hard if you're used to snacking and drinking stuff on and off all day. Not the end of the world thoughTotally! My treatment is not that long (a bit less than a year) so I haven't reached a point of high annoyance. The amount of brushing and flossing was the thing that truly annoyed me but overtime, it started to feel quite natural ? Idk I think I also may be very goal oriented and when I'm annoyed I just think and focus on the results I wanna achieve.Im just reaching month 25 …Agreed. The worst part is having to floss, rinse and brush after meal but then again my tooth have probably never been cleaner and my breath is always minty fresh.I think it just becomes a part of life after a month or so, you learn the best ways to manage it and then the maintece is second nature. I never was and probably never will be a snacker so I guess that made it easier!I'm at about 6 months. The first week or two were my tough spots.  Getting used to taking them in and out.  Not snacking as much. Little ache with new aligners. Now it's no big deal.  If I want to snack I take them out, eat. Rinse and pop them back in.  I only brush about 3 times a day.  I keep those mini flossers with me all the time.  It's easy to quickly floss with those.  If I'm out I generally just swish with water and brush when I get the chance.  I manage to get about 22 hours daily. Some days a little less. I don't overthink it.  If I'm going to a party or dinner I sometime don't wear them out.  I will wear them an extra day if I have slacked on wear time.  \\n\\nMy bite has Def changed and I eat slower and try to eat healthier. I've lost a few pounds over the past 6 months, that's a plus.  \\n\\nOne thing that I think makes it easy for me is that I'm older, 61. I had to pay the entire price, insurance won't cover when you get my age.  I'm happy that I will finally get the nice smile I've always wanted.  All in all these are so much easier than metal braces. More comfy,  not as noticeable. So glad I decided to get them!Wow! Such a truthful comment. I had wanted Invisalign for 10 years roughly so I think it may also play into the positive outlook I have even when I felt like I struggledThis is awesome! Happy for you for going after the smile you've always wanted. And 6 months in! How much longer do you have to go?At least another 6. But my son is getting married in 6 months and I won't be wearing the aligners that day and I will be huge smiling for all the pictures! That was the push I needed to go for braces! \\n\\nThank you!How much did you have you pay if you dont mind sharing? My insurance wont cover mine either since Im older so Ill have to pay all out of pocket.I paid just under $5000. I set it up on a payment plan for 2 years. I pay something like $230/month.  I am in the southern USA.  Medium size city. I did stress about this cost since I am 'retired,' but now that I'm seeing the changes in my teeth it's worth every penny.Thanks for sharing. I dont blame you for stressing out about the cost but Im glad that youre feeling that its worth it. \\n\\nIve been going back and forth about really looking into it and have seen much higher pricing than the $5000, so that seems a bit more reasonable.Only the first tray really hurt. After that, it's just been pressure for the first few hours after changing.My experience is very similar. This sub scared the crap out of me to the point I wouldnt answer my orthodontists calls to come pick up my trays for over a month. \\n\\nTurns out, only about 5% of it was the actual case. Invisalign is not nothing, but its super manageable and, in my experience, completely pain free. No need for all of this excessive wear time, tooth brushing, gear buying business at all. Take your trays out to eat and put them back in after. Otherwise, proceed with normal life. The only challenge was getting used to having them in my mouth, really.Yeah, the trouble with stuff like this is the people in pain are the most vocal.  I'm on tray 42 of 49 and zero pain.  Honestly I forget they're there must of the time until I want to eat or drink something, then you have to do the ritual.Gear buying  I bought the orthokey because I don't like putting my fingers in my mouth and that's about it lol my main challenge was the lisp I had for to weeks and as you said, just getting used to them and not eating randomlyThe lisp took a little while to go „I found mine to be quite painful initially but I had a jacked up root canal prior so it was expected. That said after a few weeks it was fine. I found I came to like the ache I had whenever I switched trays. Meant it was working. The maintece of it isnt even that bad. You get used to taking them out to eat and cleaning when you can. I know some people are really anal about brushing right after but if Im out and dont have anything on me Ill just rinse my mouth or they stay out till I get home.  Ive never had traditional braces but I suspect Invisalign is a nicer experience overall.Same for the ache hahaha I felt satisfied to know my teeth were moving. More than an ache, it just felt tight. Honestly I was so happy I could still drink my coffee even if it was with a straw and with gulps of water in between I wanted to ask you about coffee but saw there'd been so many comments already ‚ didn't want to add more questions! Do you really drink coffee through a straw? I'm a coffee fiend so might have to do the same when I get mine I only drink my coffee through a straw if it's iced tbh. I normally only drink one coffee a day so I'll have it with my meal and my aligners aren't in. But I'm also a uni student and sometimes I need coffee when my aligners need to be in. I'll drink it with a little bit of cream to try not to stain the aligners and I'll let it cool so my aligner isn't damaged either. I'll swish with water every few gulp and one big swish at the end. So far so good and no cavities! \\n\\nI do hear some ppl actually drink coffee hot/cold through the straw. I think it's more useful if you're someone that likes to sip it through the day which isn't really my case.Omg thank you for reminding me not to drink hot drinks with my aligners in ¦\\x8f¼\\x8dï¸\\x8f‚ thanks for such a detailed reply this is really helpful!Just got my first tray on Tuesday and so far its been pretty painful for the first three days. Its the worst when I take them off to eat. Im hoping for the light at the end of the tunneli experienced the EXACT SAME thing. whenever i would take them out to eat for the first week or two, my bottom teeth would hurt like hell and id stand there clutching my mouth. but after those first few weeks, you get used to it and its definitely not as bad. honestly, ive gotten to like the ache that it gives my teeth at beginning of a new set. there is light at the end, trust me.Hang in there! I think that we also get used to the pain at least a little bit, to the pain. I remember when I started and the ache was very present but as the aligners went on, it started to be in the background of my brain since I was used to having them inWee! Thats what im hoping for. I know the pain definitely is part of the process and is super manageable. Im so excited for the results. Good luck with yours!It gets better! I was having massive regrets the first few days but everything will settle in quite soon.Im 5 weeks in. First week was easily the most painful. Im switching trays weekly, so my mouth does stay moderately sore, which takes some of the joy out of eating. But the super uncomfortable part is gone after week 1.I got my first tray on Tuesday, too! I find the most pain is taking them off. There's a bottom tooth that is super sensitive and I feel like the tray removal just really intensifies it. And then I have to give my mouth a few minutes to settle before I try and bite, my bite even after only 4 days, feels off, which surprised me. I thought it would take longer for that. My main gripe is that I can't close my mouth naturally at rest with them in and I hate how it ooks. I hope it improves. Otherwise wearing them feels great and I actually think it looks strangely cute when I'm talking and smiling.as someone with sensory issues and an *absolute baby* when it comes to pain who already deals with chronic sharp pain with chronic illness, im very grateful for this sub. Im much more prepared than I would have been otherwise.\\n\\nwith aquaphor, midol (it helps with pain inear my head better than anything else for some reason), along with prepared soft foods (boiled eggs, bread soaked in soup, thinly sliced deli meat, grated cheese, smoothies, and pouches of yogurt, of applesauce, of chia seeds, and of mashed veggies/fruit), ive been able to handle it. the first tray sucked - i didnt realize how much of my mood was affected by pain - but after adjusting to the dullness of the pain (and the fact that dull pain doesnt SPIKE like sharp pain does!!!) im doing pretty good at the end of my first day of tray 2.\\n\\nits like a corset for my teeth, almost. a tight, shaping, mouth-bone hug ‚\\n\\nif anyones reading the comments, if you dont have sensory issues or issues with pain - youll be fine!\\n\\nand if you DO have some of the issues I doIve found it manageable ’œMy first tray hurt like hell for about a 24 hours, I had Tylenol but couldnt sleep the first night and took a sick day. \\n\\nPast that, changing trays hurts a bit so I put them on at night. A little sore taking them out for breakfast but a single Tylenol takes care of it. \\n\\nThe maintece is a little aggravating but Im not so strict, I probably wear them 18 hours a day. Weekly changes.\\n\\nEveryones experience is probably different but thats mine.Agreed, when I was reading this subreddit I thought the pain would be a lot worse.  Maybe I'll run into it on a future tray, but I just started tray four and I haven't really had any pain.\\n\\nMild discomfort while taking the trays out, and on my first tray it was uncomfortable to bite down too hard with my front 2 upper teeth, but outside of that, nothing.  When I put in a new tray I can certainly feel that they are tighter and are pushing on my teeth, but I certainly wouldn't classify it as pain.  I actually kind of like swapping to a new tray to feel the pressure and know that my teeth are actually moving.This has been my experience as well! New trays are uncomfortable for me for only about 10 minutes, and then I guess I get used to them. I haven't had any trays that were unbearable at all and I'm 5 months in. The worst part is how long my teeth cleaning routine is every night ‚ and having attachments on all of my teeth is annoying, but that's more of a cosmetic annoyance than anything else. It's really such an easy experience for me. I don't brush or floss after *any* meal, just swish with water and pop my trays back in. I went in for a teeth cleaning last month and had zero cavities and they said I was doing a great job...so... ‚·\\x8f¼\\x8dï¸\\x8fSame Im finishing up my first week and its an absolute breeze. And if this is the hardest week then great.Worst part of Invisalign to me is the attachments. Necessary but annoyingwhy do you find them annoying? I have them too except having them fall sometimes I don't see any problemFor example I have an attachment on every one of my top teeth. So at this point its like having braces with all the added bumps. Nothing invisible about them but oh well Im used to it and almost doneAhh, I have only 2 on the top and 4 on bottom, I didn't really care about visibility I chose invisalign because it's easier for the hygieneThanks so much for this. I am due to collect my first trays in 10 days time. At 55, I am nervous, but also excited that I might finally get the smile Ive always wanted. My hubby will prepare some softer food to begin with, and hoping I will be absolutely fine after a day or two. Fingers crossed \\x8f»I was nervous too during my first night, I did take Tylenol in case but the next day I was feeling very minimal pain. I really hope you get a positive experience! I waited for so long to get Invisalign and I really don't regret my decisionThank you. I am hoping my experience is a positive one too. Really good to know you dont regret doing it.Im 70 years old and just finished 43 out of 43 trays. I always wanted pretty teeth and now have them. The trays never hurt in the beginning. Later they often hurt a little  the first two days after a tray change. My Otho wants me to wear my retainer trays fir 15 hours a day for 3 months before switching to only overnight. HVing trouble figuring out when to where them.Thank you! Due to some scheduling mishaps, I got my aligners two days before I flew to Coachella. I was so terrified after I found this sub that Id made a terrible mistake, but it was fine. Honestly, barely noticed. Carried mouthwash and floss picks, got a PUL tool (idk why everyone doesnt use them ” lifesaver), carried on as normal. \\n\\nIm only in month one but its really been a breeze. The attachments kinda bothered me, but it was just like an itch, and Ive gotten used to them. I took ibuprofen when I switched to my second aligner, and either that worked or it was a placebo effect. Do it, yall.I just dont understand why its so hard to put on retainers for people. I get that depending on how much movement is happening, some people get more pain but it always gets better, there is Tylenol and like\\n\\nIve seen people say they wish they got traditional braces.\\n\\nPeople would rather have metal.\\n\\n\\nAttached.\\n\\nTo their teeth.\\n\\n\\nThan to wear plastic retainers.\\n\\nBruhI understand the desire to reassure people, but pain is a very individual experience. Some people are more tolerant to it than others. My teeth discomfort was pretty significant and I did have trouble eating at the beginning and sometimes throughout the treatment on the first few days of a new tray. There were also really bad headaches. Dismissing the reports that people post as just œpeople want to complain and get comforted\\x9d is not helpful to new people who may go into it thinking they will be fine but turns out they struggle with it more.The point of the post is not to minimize anyone's pain, it's only to help others who are scared of Invisalign based on the posts that are in this sub. When I joined this sub before getting my first tray, I was truly terrified and then I realized that few ppl talk about how positive/easy it can be. I'm not trying to dismiss ppl, but to encourage ppl that may feel like it's not worth it because so many ppl share their bad experiences compared to the ppl that share mainly positive onesFair enough. Thank you for taking the time to respond and provide additional clarification. Looks like the post is providing lots of conversation and hopefully it will help prospective œInvisaligners\\x9dmake the best decision for themselvesNo one is dismissing people who experience pain from Invisalign. This is a subreddit where people share experiences. And a lot of those are shared people who struggle with pain. \\n\\nHowever, I couldnt agree with OP more, and dont know why youre dismissing their experience.I agree. I've gotten migraines for years and expected major pain. (fingers crossed that they are less after I'm finished with Invisalign because my job will be in better alignment and that will take pressure off) \\n\\nI think I used Tylenol for maybe the first week but it wasn't bad at all.  I've had way worse pain just living my life …My first tray was so bad that I didnt think I could continue. Its much better now, but occasionally I will get an aligner that really hurts.Honestly its been way too easy so far and im 45 trays in. \\nNo trayminder app, no keeping track of time, no issues at all really other than that ive had to change/remove certain foods from my diet. \\n\\nChewing gum is out which is quite obvious but habits like snacking became less favourable which in itself isnt a bad thingI love the happy posts. Ive made one too, I dreaded starting Invisalign because I thought I wouldnt be able to enjoy myself. I thought Id be in miserable pain. None of that has happened. I know everyones experience is different but I expected it to be much worse, especially because I have some serious crowding as well. . Of course some discomfort is expected, we have plastic trays forcing our teeth into new places after x amount of years, but nothing like some of these posts Ive seen. I empathize with those in pain but Im also very blessed and lucky to be on the mild discomfort side with you, interweb stranger !I could not agree more with this comment! So glad someone said it. I have just finished after 14 months. There was very little pain - just a slight bit of discomfort at the beginning. The first few times taking the retainers out was anxiety-inducing - but you get the hang of it fast and then it's easy. Take a mini cleaning kit out with you - toothpaste, floss, tooth brush, etc - so it's easy to sort your teeth out when you eat out. I agree with what someone else said to - if you keep your goals in mind then the minor inconvenience is absolutely worth it. My attachments were removed yesterday and my teeth feel so smooth it's amazing. Good luck and don't hesitate to anyone thinking about it or worried - it's completely manageable, becomes a regular part of your life, and time flies.Yes! I have a little kit and I take it everywhere with me. I went on Amazon and the dollar store to built it, it really doesn't need to be fancy or expensivePerfect! I did the same. I got a little pouch for a dollar or so at Ikea and took it everywhere with me - including hiking and camping!Agree with this wholeheartedly! I have just been scanned for retainers and had pretty much the whole hog with Invisalign: elastics, attachments on all teeth, extensive IPR, bonding. \\n\\nMy experience as a whole was extremely positive. Im not going to lie, IPR is not exactly enjoyable but in terms of pain it was way down at a 2/10. The same with the aligners. Im super lucky as I had pretty much no rubbing (maybe thats due to tolerance from having metal braces about 15 years ago?). The only painful aligner for me was the second after a lot of IPR, other than that there was just a bit of aching for a few days. \\n\\nI was terrified when I started due to all the horror stories but Im SO glad I went with it anyway. Everyone is different but it was 100% worth it. Also dont buy loads of gadgets, but I would highly recommend an orthokey tool.Amen. I completely agree. \\nI did have elastics, they were a pain to get in at first, but once you master the technique they were so easy to pop in and out. \\n\\nIm a bit of a rebel and only wear my trays for approx 16hours/day - Im tracking along, orthodontist hasnt questioned my wear time at all \\xadHonestly I don't even count the hours ¡ I simply eat and roughly an hour after I put them back in and everything has been tracking nicely. As a uni student, I go out at least once a week and have them off for like 8 hours or something and so far, it hasn't been a big deal/ lead to tracking issues. Ppl think too much imoIm still unsure if I want to go forward. Ive tried telling my dentist I dont want to have attachments on my front teeth and they refuse to listen to me. Its ridiculous that I havent even heard what my treatment will be until I go in to get the trays. Very frustrating. All my trays are ready, and Im sure they plan to put attachments on my front teeth. Guess Ill be walking outAny particular reason why you don't want attachments on your front teeth? I have at least one attachment on most of my teeth and two attachments on my upper front tooth. You can't really see the one in the front and they don't bother me at all when I eat. Honestly the rear molar ones are more annoying because they sometimes pinch my cheeks when I eat. First week they felt like someone glued gravel in my mouth. A week later they feel much better. I'm hoping they continue to smooth out.Both of my front teeth are porcelain crowns. I just really dont feel comfortable with attachments being there and Ive tried to make this known to the dentist. Also I really dont like how they look. That sounds petty, I know, but I do think theyre noticeable and Ive already gone through 4 years of metal braces when I was younger. It makes me crazy that Invisalign doesnt even tell you about attachments before getting the trays in. The only reason I learned about them is from scouring this subreddit to find more info. When youve gone years of wanting Invisalign not knowing that attachments exists, its really annoying that you finally can afford to get it and they act like attachments are no big deal. And maybe they arent a big deal to most people, but its unfair that they seem to hide them until its time to glue them.I had this same concern because I have 4 porcelain crowns in my mouth and a fair amount of fillings on the sides of my teeth. I asked a lot of questions before I let them put them on. I was also not told about attachments,  just that I'd need rubber bands prior to paying/signing up. This is what they told me. They put a different material on porcelain crowns because they don't want to damage the crown. She also told me that when they go to remove the attachments they use a special drill that will only remove the composite material and use a black light after to make sure they remove all of it when your treatment is done. I've also got rubber bands so I'm not getting away with someone noticing I've got something going on in my mouth. I asked them WHY the attachments are necessary and she said it just gives retainers a little more torque to move your teeth. That they are basically the braces of invisilign. Anyway, I don't know if this helps your situation at all, but don't hesitate to ask a ton of questions. If they aren't answering your questions I'd see if you can transfer to another Ortho. I'm doing invisilign to save my front teeth. I've got a misaligned bite from wearing an over the counter night guard.My first week was really rough, but it's been 5 months since, no issuesI agree its not that bad!  Pain is tolerable and goes away after 3 day per new tray. No biggie.Yeah I definitely didnt need to buy that wax and a travel tooth brush lolIve never had an issue with them even from the get go, its been so manageableSimilar experience - it's more of an inconvenience than anything else (I'm about 6 weeks into treatment).Couldn't agree more! A bit of an inconvenience, the constant brushing and flossing does get a bit much but I found once I got into the routine it was easy enough to get used to. I'd really encourage anyone who's sitting on the fence to go for it.I've been wearing mine for 25 weeks and get literally no pain on my weekly changes, and I barely wear my aligners for 15 hrs (ãƒ»_ãƒ»;)I havent had any pain: nothing like braces when I had pain from really sharp wires poking into my cheek. The only thing I had was catching my cheek at the back when I put my trays on for the first few days. \\n\\nMy trays change every 7 days so I dont worry about staining. I rarely brush them and just rinse them and chuck them into the Dentalpod ultrasonic cleaner that I bought. Taking the trays off can be a pain sometimes so its worth having an Orthokey. \\n\\nI use an interdental brush instead of floss because its much easier and quicker. I learnt on this forum to brush after instead of before breakfast so that I only have to brush once. \\n\\nOne attachment fell off in the first week and another fell off in week 3. Im just going to have them replaced at the next appointment in week 5.i agree. invisalign, for me at least, is definitely preferable to braces. its less painful and, of course, you can eat normally. the only thing i would say sucked is that if youre going to get rubber bands in the future, your slingers will have these hook-like things at the top and bottom of the sets. the ones on the top are kinda painful at first, because they dig into the inside of your lip. but after some days, your mouth gets tougher, and it doesnt hurt as much.Im on my tray 3 /20, no significant pain yet. Do you have experience with chewies? My orthodontist did not mentioned them but I just found out about them and wondering if I should get some to try. Do they really help?I did get chewies and used them in the beginning but k stopped because it fell into my toilet and I never replaced it. Since the little incident, I went to my orthodontist twice and he said my tracking was excellent. So truly, idk how good the chewies are since I'm doing good without themThen I dont think I need themWow thank you!Id say it likely depends on the exact treatment required. If your teeth barely need to move, of course it wont hurt as much. If your teeth have larger movements they need to make such as twisting or closing a gap, it will likely be more painful. \\n\\nI am on tray 38/46, and my most painful tray is the one Im wearing now. I had a significant gap between my front teeth that was also flared outward when I started. Since then the flare has been mostly handled as the teeth closed together. \\n\\nAs of this tray, however, that gap between the two front teeth is becoming negligible, to the point where the gums that *used* to sit between those teeth is getting very tightly squeezed to close it, to the point of severe inflammation and bleeding. The bleeding is enough of a problem that taking my aligners out these past few days have led to a very foul taste behind those two teeth thats a bit like if I had to imagine what rusty iron tastes like. Putting my trays back in, the first two days, would start the bleeding all over again. It seems my teeth just *really* dont want to close that gap, so this tray has been more of an issue than others. I had to use orajel just getting the trays in to reduce the pain. \\n\\nAnd its not just bleeding gums. The first two days of having this tray in were accompanied by a constant dull stinging sensation in those two teeth along with sinus pressure, which led to a more severe headache than usual. I can attribute it to the trays because when I took them out to eat, the pressure vanished, and no stinging sensation at all. Thankfully, on day 3 now, this has cleared up. \\n\\nAll that said its still very mild discomfort. It sounds bad on paper when someone talks about the kind of pain or symptoms they might have with Invisalign, but for those lurking and feeling anxious: keep in mind that in the vast majority of cases, even those reporting severe discomfort have that discomfort clear up within 2-3 days of starting a new tray, and Ibuprofen or Tylenol is usually enough to dull it. \\n\\nDont let fear of a few days of pain keep you from the smile youve been wanting all your life. Its absolutely 1000% worth it, and I would do it all over again if I had to, and Im not even done yet.Jesus, the gums do sound painful. My bottom teeth were pretty badly crooked with twisting movements. That was the aligner that hurt the most, when the tooth with the major problem started to move. I definitely agree it depends on your treatment and when the problematic teeth are getting a lot of movementTotally agreed! \\n\\nThe first tray SUCKED. I was so worried I was going to be at that level of pain the entire time, but by the fourth tray it really wasnt bad. Im on tray 19 now with 10 day changes and its become a breeze. The pain in minimal, maybe slight discomfort on tray change day. Theyre easier to remove now (omg the first tray I was sure it was never coming out), and the routine of brushing after eating is habitual. \\n\\nAll in all it IS annoying to deal with but so incredibly worth it.I think the hardest part for most people is that you do have to change your eating/drinking habits significantly if you're a snacker/grazer. I needed to lose some weight anyway, so I just embraced the Invisalign diet. It's very effective. No snacking and only drinking water except for meals. If that sounds terrible to you and you don't want to do it, braces might be a better option. With braces you can continue snacking and drinking things other than water, but they're also a lot more annoying when it comes to teeth cleaning, and painful. I had braces when I was a teenager and I'd take invisalign any day.Dis you have any attachments removed?  That's what I'm afraid of.Sometimes it does really hurt in the beginning, especially if you have a ton of attachments. That does go away and becomes more manageable when figuring out how to take them off properly. Depending on the severity of your teeth, it is 100% worth it. If experiencing issues, look at youtube or talk to others and pretty much any problem can be solved. I'm so used to the aligners now that it feels strange without them, to be honest. I've had mine for a fairly long time, though.I 100% agree. I started with braces and they were HORRIBLE! I had them on for four months and decided to switch to Invisalign for an extra $1000. Best money Ive ever spent! I havent had any problems with Invisalign-especially compared to braces. I am a HUGE snacker and Invisalign forced me into being more mindful of what I eat. I have also been a nail biter my whole life and after treatment I havent ever bitten my nails again. I cant enough great things about Invisalign!One thing that made mine less expensive is that I don't care if they are absolutely perfect. I didn't want my mouth reshaped, what is that, palate extender? I just wanted my teeth straighter.  If I was still in my 20s or 30s I probably would have.  But being in my 60s I simply want straighter teeth.Sincerely thank you to everyone sharing here. Im on tray 1 and have been really struggling with pain and discomfort from elastics as well as frustration with the whole routine.

This is what was prescribed for me.

Did your provider suggest them? Did you have to ask? \\n\\nI\\'m approaching the end of my treatment and there\\'s been no mention of bonding/IPR/whitening yet.. I\\'m wondering if I should bring them up.Think it depends on where you live and what kind of provider you selected. Cosmetic dentists typically quote or suggest these things up front as part of the perfect smile or smile transformation consultations while regular dentists and orthodontist in certain countries may be limited in what they can perform so typically dont or cant include them. \\n\\nI would ask - but you may either be charged extra or be referred elsewhere. Unfortunately if not in your contract/quote you agreed to they may not be included.I appreciate the response, thank you!\\n\\nFor reference, I went through a local orthodontist. I went through the Treatment Contract last night and it says the Treatment Type is \"Adult Comprehensive.\" And then in the \"Non-Ideal Results\" section it says, \"Restorative dental treatment, such as esthetic bonding, crowns or bridges or periodontal therapy, may be indicated. You are encouraged to ask your orthodontist and family dentist about adjunctive care.\" \\n\\nThere\\'s no further details surrounding either of these, so it\\'s not *super* helpful. I\\'ll have the ask when I go in for a checkup with the Orthodontist Owner in a few weeks.Yes, it seems hit or miss as Invisalign trays can obviously only move the teeth - everything else would be dependent on the providers skills and what they are allowed to do per each jurisdictions standards.\\n\\nFor example where I am outside of the US, orthodontists refer you other practices for bonding so most treatment plans here dont include it.

Has eating been inconvenient?Yes and I called them crying the second day saying I couldnt eat and clean and all that while still keeping them in for 22 hours lol Im a slow eater so its been tricky but now Im in a good place. The first few days was rough cause my attachments shifted my bite so I just had easy food like corn dogs and mashed potatoes. Also do add - I took Tylenol the first few days cause the aligners were hard to take out. My advice would be to take them out quicker rather than slowly and when snapping them in, push in the side thats most painful first.Thanks! What was the result of the bite shifting, why did that make it harder?\\n\\nThanks for the tips! I\\'ve also found quicker to be less painful, I think (of course it could be correlation rather than causation, where as time has gone on it hurts less *and* I can do it more quickly, but it\\'d make sense either way.) Snapping them in starting with the most painful side is an interesting tip I will try!\\n\\nI haven\\'t been taking Tylenol yet just since I want to observe and acclimate to however painful it starts off; then, if I take it down the line on future trays, I\\'ll know how much good it\\'s doing me.\\x9dï¸\\x8f\\x9dï¸\\x8f\\x9dï¸\\x8f\\x9dï¸\\x8f Never feel shy about sending me a DM!Yes it gets better, your mouth,tongue will adjust so just keep talking to yourself at home or when you cooking out loud and the words will come out easier.\\n\\nEvery new tray you might have a lisp but it should get less and lessIm on my second to last tray and honestly sometimes I still have a lisp! Most of the time it isnt noticeable at ALL but I find my mouth gets dryer with Invisalign which causes the lisp. Loud bars and yelling = lisp.. work calls, cant tell at all. Definitely gets better and most people will never notice unless you tell them.How common is it for attachments to fall off? \\n\\nIt\\'s my first day with them and when I ate for the first time, 2 fell off. I called my ortho and I\\'m getting them replaced next week. They told me it\\'s not a big deal, but I\\'m just wondering is this gonna be a common thing? Kind of tedious to keep calling whenever there\\'s a mishapI\\'ve heard of many people have attachments fall off - I got mine on today and lost one immediately during eating. Luckily they were able to get me back in and apply a new one on the same day. I think there\\'s a number of factors at play - including how the attachment was applied - so it\\'s not entirely on the patient.\\n\\nI\\'m being super-cautious now that I\\'m eating dinner - super soft foods, careful chewing (hard not to with the sharp edges on these things) and constantly checking if the attachments are still there.\\n\\nI imagine after a while I\\'ll feel more confident in their adhesion, and people say that the sharp edges tend to wear down over time, but it\\'s definitely an adjustment for now.Definitely. Eating is such a pain and feels so weird right now. Good luck tomorrow morning though. The first day felt like nothing but my teeth hurt like hell the 2nd day.I thought you\\'re not supposed to eat with them in!?The aligned trays, yes, they need to come out while eating, but the attachments are glued onto the teeth, so no eating with attachments would be rather difficult.Mine fall off all the timeDo the attachment bumps cut up the inside of your mouth when you eat? The trays themselves are fine but when I take them out the bumps (dental cement or whatever) cut up my mouth when I eat. Help?Same here. I keep biting  the inside of my mouth.Yes, when I eat it happens. I\\'m on day 5 of my journey so I guess skin will get used to it.You get used to it, it doesnt happen the whole time. You adjust to eating carefully and eating softer foods. The only time that happens to me now is if Im shivering uncontrollably ‚Am I over doing it?\\n\\nI\\'m about half way through (22/43) and I\\'m tired of all the taking the aligners off, eating, brushing my teeth, washing the aligners, putting them back... for absolutely everything!\\n\\nI used to have 3 meals + 2 snacks but now I\\'m just having 3 meals. Even going to the gym fasted early in the morning for not having to do all the ordeal, while I\\'d like to have a protein shake...\\n\\nDo you all do the entire thing? Or just depending on what you\\'re eating or drinking?I do the entire thing, plus rubber bands. 55 weeks in with hopefully not many more to go. I figure, I did all this for a reason: to have a nice smile. I figure if I do everything right, I\\'ll have the highest chance of that happening. My eating habits have drastically changed, as well as my gym routine... But it\\'s only temporary. Hang in there.Just curious, how exactly does it change gym routine for someone?What all has changed about your eating habits, and what do you do with rubber bands?Rubber bands are used to fix my slight under bite (pull the top teeth forward and lower teeth back). \\n\\nBecause it\\'s a hassle to take rubber bands/trays out, eat, brush my teeth, put the trays/rubber bands in, then bite on my little chewy thing, I\\'ve transitioned to eating fewer, significantly larger meals per day (I used to eat smaller meals nearly nonstop).Got it, thanks! Should I assume rubber bands aren\\'t necessary in my specific case if my dentist said nothing about them?Depends what I\\'m eating and when. I brush after each meal so if I need to have a snack an hour or two before that, I just take the trays out, swish with water and put them back in. Might not be the ideal practice but it keeps me from starving and my wear time is high.If you are cavity prone Id recommend doing it all. But there was so many days where Id just rinse my mouth and put them back. Also if I was ever out of the house I would chew gum and put them back in. just make sure you brush and floss at the end of the night. Actually I didnt even flood most days just brushed well at nightWhat does chewing gum do?Picks out all the food from the teethGot it, thanks! I\\'ll try to keep that in mind for when I can\\'t necessarily brush right away while I\\'m at work.Thanks for asking this. I\\'m on day 2 week 1 and I\\'ve already noticed my habits change too.\\n\\nHeadaches, but also a pain to take these out with the oral care everytime I eat or drink. So I\\'ve just been drinking water and eating a lot less.\\n\\nMeanwhile I\\'m going crazy from cravings and focusing on these Headaches bc I can\\'t focus on anything forget themIm on my 4th tray starting today. Im definitely hungry a lot and usually only eat breakfast, lunch and dinner. Yesterday I was at Disneyland celebrating my daughters birthday and it was such a hassle. I practically starved most of the day. I drank water and ate a lot of fruit which I figured didnt require me to flossThis is probably over asked but is getting Invisalign fairly (inexpensive? Cheap?) reasonable in terms of price? Ive never had braces but my mom always wishes she got me braces growing up for a crooked tooth and Im considering it if its reasonable.Total treatment is 5,770. Got a $500 discount, so 5,270. Put 1,670 down and make $150 monthly payments for 24 months, interest free! My best advise is shop around and do consultations! A lot of places have flexible payment plans :)I went with an orthodontist, who has his own tray making system, and he\\'s only doing 4 months and slight adjustments to 2 overlapping teeth. $2100 US. I was quoted $4500 by a dentist for Invisalign, but went to the Ortho based on recommendations in this sub.I just got quoted 6800 USD for 24 months.Cost me about $5k. I got a discount for paying in full.i just started today, paid 6500 canadian over 20 months, 1000 down paymentMine is 5000 USD. All paid at once, my insurance doesn\\'t cover braces of any kind for adults. I\\'d say it\\'s expensive.\\n\\nI had braces as a kid too but didn\\'t wear my retainers... but had a bunch of work in my mouth going on that *mostly* stuck, so now I only have to wear these for 36 trays, changed weekly.I paid $500 down and $230 per month over the next year. But I could have done $150 but it would have interest.I have the comprehensive treatment for $5,475 (USD). Paid $1,700 down and have a fairly aggressive payment schedule at \\\\~$300/month for a year. My treatment time is short however.If you don\\'t pay for it now, you might end up with more expensive dental problems later on when you get older and your jaw naturally narrows. I woke up one day with a noticeable chip out of my tooth just from my teeth shifting naturally (I\\'ve never had braces). Went to an ortho immediately.Learned my lesson pm not drinking cold water today. I was in so much pain until they warmed upWhat\\'s this in reference to? With the trays on or off? I just got mine on a few hours ago and haven\\'t heard about cold waterEveryone including my ortho said cold water is fine but I found that as soon as I drank them within a few hours of my first tray, I was in so much pain. It could honestly just be a coincidence but it didnt hurt like that until after I had the ice water.Interesting, thanks! I haven\\'t had any issues with it yet but also haven\\'t drank anything ice cold. I appreciate the heads up!When I switched from tray 1 to 2, the new tray felt tight and it \"snapped\" in place  \\nWhen I switched from tray 2 to 3, the new try felt looser and there wasn\\'t a perceivable \"snap\" effect on my teeth.  How do I know if this is normal or not? Maybe I should switch back to the previous tray for an extra day or two?Happened to me and didnt swap back, i would just keep with it and use the chewie , especially when switching to new trays chewis is very good.\\n\\nWont always snap but just feel comfortable enough and not loose.Whats a chewie?would be this.\\n\\n[https://www.amazon.com.au/Aligner-Chewies-Invisalign-Trays-Scented/dp/B016DUQTZA](https://www.amazon.com.au/Aligner-Chewies-Invisalign-Trays-Scented/dp/B016DUQTZA)\\n\\nThats from a quick google so please look on your own but thats the picture of them,just put on tray #2.... ITS SO TIGHT HELP \\xadHow are you doing now?good! it doesnt hurt anymore and i dont have issues taking it off when i eatAwesome! So glad to hear that. Was your experience with tray #1 a similar case of it lessening over time?I did this today and holy shit my teeth are KILLING me. So much pain.stay strong. you got this!! i was fine after like 3 daysI\\'m on day 2:\\nWhat will happen if I drink 1-2 cups of coffee (black) 5 days a week (M-F) with them in? \\n\\nDo I need a special cleaner on the aligners other than a little brushing with toothpaste when I regular brush?\\n\\nAnyone else have anxiety due to the feeling in your mouth? \\n\\nThanks!Im on day 3. My dentist said its not ideal to drink coffee with them in but its not the worst.\\nSecond day I drank 2 lattes and swished with water (I was in a meeting).\\nToday I was home so used mouthwash.\\nToo early for me to tell if this is reasonable but hopefully some of the veterans will chime inMine got a little yellowed from drinking a bunch of coffee daily with two week changes. Not enough to bother me (tea did though - I don\\'t recommend drinking black tea with trays in). I wash with toothpaste or dish soap and sometimes soak them in hydrogen peroxide.Best mobile toothbrush/cleaning set ups? Anyone try the Colgate wisps?Does drinking stuff that isn\\'t water simply stain the trays, or can it affect the function of the plastic? I don\\'t think I\\'ll try this because I usually just drink water anyways, but I\\'m curious.Its really the staining and bacteria/sugar stuff that can cause gum,teeth issues sitting on the tooth.\\n\\nObviously drinking hot drinks through it can warp them on top of staining but apart from that those are the main reasons.That makes sense... Thanks!Obviously it depends what drink you\\'re speaking of, but I think the biggest risk is enamel loss due to anything carbonated or acidic being held against your teethI just got my first tray fitted today, tray 1 of 15. Is it normal that Im not feeling sore? I did have a bit of looseness in my lower teeth because Im 9 months postpartum (another joy of pregcy is loosened ligaments and even teeth sometimes).My dentist told me that in her experience, pregcy and loosened ligaments can result in the teeth moving more quickly and with less discomfort. I did specifically ask her about it because I\\'m trying to conceive and I was worried that becoming pregt in the middle of my Invisalign treatment might cause issues because of the looser teeth thing. I didn\\'t realize that that could continue postpartum. That\\'s interesting!Yes my teeth have continued to feel wobbly and loose; it was even giving me nightmares of losing my teeth or all of my teeth sliding around and probably causing me to test out the wiggly-ness of them even more. \\n\\nWith each child I had (my third and last baby is 8 months old now), my teeth that were once straight after a year of braces when I was 12, got more and more crowded with a slight zigzag look. They still look straight unless you look closely or if I open my mouth, but what prompted me to go to the ortho was knowing that with the looseness theyll probably get worse or even fall out if theyre not stabilized.\\n\\nIm on day 4, and its definitely been an easy adjustment so far. I think the looseness helps, but Im just hoping that theyll firm up well afterwards. The ortho said Ill need a permanent retainer bar behind the lower teeth.ill be honest im a bit scared - \\n\\ncurrently on 3/33, got the rubber bands and the attachments. ortho is a great guy, long respected ortho with a strong history. \\n\\nafter the attachments and the bands, i went to my barber and we were discussing it, he mentioned that the process messed up his jaw/bite permanently, aka what im trying to fix with my bite.\\n\\nim just extremely worried that there is the possibility that this could happen. has anyone here experienced that?Trust your Orthodontist over your barber.Truth Ive been wearing the bands and its not so bad anymoreHow common are the rubber bands with invisalign? Do people take them off for pictures and such (thus creating the appearance that they are less common than they are)?Depends if you have bite issues. I don\\'t, so I don\\'t have the rubber bands.Is it possible for bad tracking to fix itself if I increase my wear time and start using chewies more often? Went to the dentist recently and was told a couple teeth weren\\'t tracking as well as they should, but for us to wait and see. I\\'d rather not extend my treatment if possible, so I\\'ve been chomping on my chewie like a dog ever since.Stubborn teeth are common and refinements are usually necessary to \\'focus\\' on the tooth needing to be moved more.\\n\\nJust stick the course and be compliant. dont over do the chewie as it can damage the tray and wear it out/crack. Just do it normally and see how the journey goes. most refinements are 1 week trays so it usually flys by and you barely notice the extra wear time because you been doing it for ages, \\n\\nPlus you wear a retainer for the rest of your life to keep them in place at night so just have to get use to wearing them.Ok, I was worried maybe I\\'m not doing enough and that\\'s why I had some stubborn teeth, but I\\'ll just keep complying and won\\'t overdo the chewie. Thank you :)How do I floss if I have permet retainers on?! I just got them on and I can no longer use my flossers :(Buy the little plastic sticks with rubber brushes at the end, rather than trying to use floss string.Are those reusable? I thought of buying them but they are expensive.They\\'re not supposed to be. And yeah they are expensive depending on where you get them from, I found them at the dollar store for much cheaper. idk what country you\\'re in.. check Amazon and buy in bulkI have an appointment to get my attachments and aligners on June 1st. My honeymoon in June 17th. Should I postpone for when I return?Maybe? It\\'s not the most stressful thing in the world removing your retainers, timing your meal, cleaning your retainers and then cleaning your teeth before putting them back in...\\\\*but\\\\* I think your honeymoon would be a lot more relaxing without the hassle. Will you be out and about a lot? I\\'ve had my Invisalign since December and have been mostly fine...I stick to restaurants that I know have nice clean, private bathrooms so I can clean in peace. however, I just got back from my first vacation abroad since having them in and I have to say it was ANNOYING. I was meeting with friends around town a lot, and in new places where I would go to the bathroom to remove my retainers before eating and just think \"nope no way am I using this bathroom to clean my teeth!\" Because you will most likely be out of town, you won\\'t have as much control over access to somewhere clean to clean your teeth and retainers after meals, so it could be a nuisance. Having said that, if you\\'re going to a remote cottage or something and plan on staying in/close to the house/apartment all the time, or going to a resort where you can just run up to your room whenever you want to brush your teeth, it probably won\\'t bother you as much.Thank you. This was helpful. Yes, I\\'ll be out and about a lot so I\\'m trying to reschedule it.How much does an initial consultation for Invisalign cost where they take a look, show what the  end result could be, and determine what all could be involved? Would your normal dentist do this or would you have to go to some specialist? Can Invisalign handle if a tooth needs to be rotated a little?Impossible to say how much it costs without knowing your location.\\n\\nThey\\'ll take a look at your teeth and if you\\'re a good candidate and you want to sign up for it, you make an appointment to get your teeth scanned so they can create the 3D model etc.\\n\\nInvisalign can do rotations, depends on your situation.\\n\\nGo to an ortho that specialises in Invisalign. There\\'s a list on the website.ThanksHas anyone noticed their teeth changing height/shape? I did Invisalign on dentist recommendation because my top row was crooked and hurt. Im now on my second to last tray and noticed 2/4 of my bottom front-most teeth are sticking up higher than the two next to them, like a gopher. And the top of those teeth are wavy, but werent like that before. Starting to worry that Ive created a problem while solving another ¶Anyone with invisalign retainers,, what tablets do you use to clean them ?Im a fan of retainer brite, you can find it on Amazon.Im on tray 17/20 and Im not happy with the progress so far :(My dentist quoted me$4800, Id need to wear for 12 months. \\n\\nMy teeth are pretty straight already, just some slight crowding in bottom middle teeth, nothing major. \\n\\nIs this high or normal?Just because they look good from the front, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not complex. My top front teeth looked good, and the bottom-front teeth don\\'t take long to straighten. The reason I\\'m on Invisalign for so long is because the molars and canines take forever to move.I\\'m supposed to need invisaligners (or braces in general), and I have several questions:\\n\\n1. I believe they told me I only need like 3 months or something like that (it may have been 6, but I know it was a lot less time than I\\'ve heard braces take). Is this normal? I don\\'t have horrible teeth, but the front of my teeth don\\'t touch the bottom, and I have a gap and one bad tooth. \\n2. My regular dr prescribed Prednisone this month, and it\\'s not a question of whether or not I should take it, but that I HAVE to (I really was trying to avoid it :/). Can I still get invisaligners? I hear they need inflammation to work, and the whole reason I\\'m taking Prednisone is to get rid of it in my neck >\\\\_<;.\\n3. Is there absolutely any way to get the cost reduced? I actually need them medically (My dr said this is possibly and likely TMJ, and the last time I went to the dentist, he said my bite is causing this, so it definitely seems medical. I\\'ve had unexplained neck pain since October of last year, and my jaw has been getting increasingly worse). But literally everything I\\'ve read says I can\\'t get help at all due to the fact I\\'m over 21. :/. My dentist\\'s price is fine (he\\'s about average for this), but I can\\'t really afford the payments. They\\'d want me at the dentist to pay half up front and then pay them $150 a month, which I can\\'t do (they originally told me it\\'d just be $150 a month for 8 months, THEN told me I have to pay half upfront.. One I could do temporarily, but the other I can\\'t. A $5500 card bill equates to like $200 a month, which I don\\'t have). I\\'d have no money except for bills. This all seems grossly unfair when this is medical, not cosmetic (I don\\'t care about the gap TBH) My doctor is even surprised they won\\'t do anything, as it is medical.I have zero idea why the dentist can\\'t just do payments there, so I don\\'t have to have such a high freaking bill due to the interest.\\n4. Would this actually get rid of TMJ? It\\'s the only reason I\\'m even considering braces. I really don\\'t care about this issue cosmetically, as I\\'ve just come to accept I have a gap.Is it normal for an orthodontist not to do the itero scan at your consultation? I was thinking I would see the Clincheck during my consultation, so I could see a possible outcome of treatment. Maybe I completely misunderstood what is done at a consultation.

This is not a good result.Im pretty happy with the result and I trust my orthodontist.\\nAll good then, all the best.\\nAll good then, all the best.You sound like wonderful dentist ‚Hey gotta respect patients decisions, if they are happy then all is good.just noticed, the photos are mirrored from each other, so it doesnt make as clear a comparisonOh you\\'re right! I was wondering how the ortho messed up a perfectly good bite on the left back side.Oops, youre totally right.They look great!Congratulations! Beautiful smile!Such a beautiful smile!!! \\x81They great. The main thing is that YOU are happy with the result.How long did it take to see a difference in your gap? Looks great!!!Thank you! Id say it took about 20 trays before the gap really closed (and then of course it got even better with refinements).Looks great! CongratulationsCongrats they look awesome!!!!!Looks great! Congrats. What a difference —‚‘\\x8dAwesome! Looks great!\"Perfect\" is all subjective. Once my trays are finished, I\\'ll still have my gap (by choice) and by the \"perfect\" standard my teeth will still be \"imperfect\" The only person who can decide what perfect teeth look and feel like is the person chewing with them. \\n\\nIn my opinion, they look awesome! How smiley are you now? LolThank you! Im very smiley these days! Mostly it feels good to have the attachments off lolCross bites can not be corrected with out braces, Im in the same boat when Im done Ill look 100% better. This looks great to me congrats!Invisalign can definitely fix a crossbite, they even list it on the website. It can\\'t fix a jaw misalignment that requires surgery, and it isn\\'t guaranteed to fix every case, but it\\'s doable. Just depends on the case and orthodontist.The key is moving molars and from what I understand once we are adults its very difficultext to impossible for Invisalign to move them.Ok, that makes sense. I\\'m moving a lateral incisor, canine, and first pre-molar, so I can\\'t personally speak for further back. I\\'ve definitely seen others here have had their posterior crossbite fixed, though. I just don\\'t want anyone to lose hope thinking it\\'s impossible when orthodontists have done it with Invisalign. If I had thought I had to get regular braces (again) I would have sat on my crossbite pain for even longer instead of going and at least seeing if it could be done. I appreciate knowing the molars are difficult to move though, it\\'s good to know why they especially hurt (because they\\'re stubborn).Invisalign moved my bottom molar to the back so that it fill the spot where the molar right next to it had been extracted.  My oral surgeon said I won\\'t need the implant that I had planned for because now that moved molar is touching my two upper back molars.  But I do notice each time I go for checkups, my ortho pays extra attention to that molar.You had a crossbite ?YesHow old where you u ?\\nI have a similar issue \\nCan I dm you ?Dont hate me but Im just gonna give my opinion. You have really nice teeth but you shouldve never been put in Invisalign. Your middle alignment is so far off and you have some gaps that need to be closed \\n\\nTrust me, I spent 2.5 years in Invisalign and just had braces placed today bc Invisalign just aint it sis\\n\\nIts not only cosmetic but you may have some bite issues as well which in the end is more important than cosmetic flawsDefinitely dont hate you and I appreciate your opinion. For someone who would not get braces, I still think Invisalign was a good option for me. I recognize it is not perfect, but my bite is much better than it was and the cosmetic changes are really impactful to me.Then thats all that matters —', 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'oral hygiene', 'tray time management', 'facial appearance', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'financial concerns'], 'scores': [0.21777814626693726, 0.16654159128665924, 0.15137986838817596, 0.12322244048118591, 0.11694349348545074, 0.11691268533468246, 0.1072218269109726]}, {'sequence': \"Been told by an orthodontist today that my teeth are likely too complex for either Invisalign or traditional braces.

Seen far worse that were suitable for Invisalign so Im confused!I also feel as though I've seen a lot worse. They said that it would be difficult to fix the overbite and my bottom front teeth are touching the back of my top teeth right up by the gumline which would stop them being able to close the gaps at the top. It's not helped by the fact that one of my incisors is a bridge and the other was a 'peg tooth' which has been built up with composite.\\n\\nI'll see what they say at my next appointment but unfortunately that's not until the middle of January.I have a deep overbite too - my top front teeth touch the gums of bottom teeth and vice versa. I have crowding of teeth as well on the upper jaw and my ortho said crowding will definitely be rectified using aligned. Reg. closing the gaps, they said it can be done with elastics but it all depends on how my jaw responds to elastics.\\n\\nSo, worry not. Try a different ortho - I hear the ones with platinum certification are more experienced and Im sure they would have handled similar challenges beforeThanks! I think the problem is that the bottom teeth have pushed the top ones forward and now there's no room to pull them back. He is a Platinum provider and also an orthodontist as opposed to a dentist. Hopefully they can pull a treatment plan out of the bag! I will see about getting another consultation in the meantime though.I don't know if this is possible, but perhaps it's worth shopping around for orthodontists who handle more complicated cases? I got lucky with my first consultation but most of the other providers I saw - my local local dentist, two platinum providers - thought my wishes were impossible.Good luck in Jan ‘\\x8dwhile that's certainly disheartening, you may well just hear good news after your ortho has his consultation. keep your head up! good luck and I hope it all works out for you!Thanks! I'm keeping my fingers crossed.I went to 3 free orthodontic consultations at orthodontic offices in my area before making a decision. You should definitely go to more free consultations in the meantime. Remember, in orthodontics, we are moving our teeth within the bone that they exist in, so each patient will have their own range of movements that are possible.Check with multiple orthodontists!Whilst they may not be able to create the perfect smile I would imagine vast improvements can be made. Ive also a deep overbite and bridge and was told Id need surgery to get everything perfect. Well one year later and Im close to being done in regards to what Invisalign can achieve and Im thrilled. Still got an overbite and my bridge will need replacing BUT my teeth are 1000 times sexier! Good luck!!Definitely go see another ortho. I had a large gap and overbite and I was able to get Invisalign.Definitely a bad sign when they are asking another colleague when your issue isn't as bad as others. I'd move on even if they do create a plan.I would definitely go to see another orthodontist. Although not everyone is the same, I have yet to meet / hear of anyone who is not a candidate for ANY type of orthodontic treatment because of the alignment of their teeth.. dental hygiene as a reason sure.. but not alignment.

I also watched my brother struggle with braces cutting up his mouth and wasn't going to deal with that.Any reason why you ditched invisalign? Seems like you still had some way to go before coming to the conclusion that it would work on you?I just hated the whole process of Invisalign. I hated how much room for user error there was. I wasn't being compliant enough, admittedly. Wearing them like maybe 18 hours a day, not cleaning my teeth properly, not doing the chewies. Just too much room for slacking.

I have had wired ceramic braces before. It was not easy as i was in lates 20s, if you don't have any other option, then go for it  and there is no point worrying about something that you can't control but your all effort to make the treatment successful and wear it with confidence. :)Thanks for this. I will definitely remember this and wear the braces with confidence. I had all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed. I originally wanted to remove my lower right canine too because there was 2 more teeth impacted around the area, but my ortho advised against it as he believed it could be resolved with invisalign.  I didnt believe him at first but now my teeth moved enough to have space for all of them. I am definitely glad I didnt remove it otherwise my bite would be a bit off later down the line.Ive had braces and currently have Invisalign and braces are worse IMO but they definitely do the jobMy upper canine just refused to come down so if this can fix that I will be happy. I will prepRe myself for the pain ....Yeah some teeth just dont respond to the plastic, especially if youve never has braces before in the past.My orthodontist switched me over to full braces after he hit some road blocks with Invisalign. My teeth were much more sore after adjustments than at any point during Invisalign. It was nice not feeling like I was always on a time crunch to put my aligners back in after eating, but flossing was a huge PITA and very time consuming with braces. Sharp wires with braces sucked, but was easily managed with dental wax.That is true about not rushing back after eating or having to take them out before drinking or eating anything. I will mentally prepare for more pain after adjustments. Will all be worth it in the end.I just got a text from my dentist saying I need to come in soon to get my sectional braces to help the stubborn last few teeth. I dont mind it but if I am honest I really am not mentally prepared for braces. I never had braces before Invisalign and I am in my 30s. Anyone has any experience similar to me please let me know any tips, anything I should be aware of that are different between braces and Invisalign? \\nAnything would be highly appreciated so I can mentally prepare myself lol.I'm 35 and had braces for the first time this past year to finish my treatment after my Ortho decided we had hit a road block with Invisalign. Braces are a nuisance just like Invisalign, but in different ways, and ultimately I found them to be less stressful because you don't have to worry about trying to maximize your wear time since obviously you have them on 24/7. \\n\\nThe main things to be aware of, IMO: \\n- The brackets can and probably will irritate your mouth and lips as you adjust to the feeling. Eventually you forget about them, but on occasion there will be some uncomfortable friction which can be relieved with dental wax.\\n- Food gets caught in the brackets all of the time so brushing is a must. You should also avoid certain foods like popcorn and sticky candy like caramels to avoid making a hot mess in your mouth lol.\\n- Flossing is a pain because you have to thread the floss underneath the wire for each individual tooth. Prepare to take added time than you would normally would to floss or use a water pik to forgo flossing altogether. Then again you'll have sectional braces so maybe it won't be that big of a deal for you!\\n\\nGood luck!Oh this is super helpful thank you so much!

When I go in for checkups, I see the hygienist, and rarely the orthodontist. In fact, for the last 2 years I've only seen the hygienist.  They do my rescans,  set me up when the trays come in, and then deside where the elastics should go. I'm nearing the end of my most recent set and my bite is still not lining up. The hygienist have finally asked the orthodontist to chime in on my treatment.  They've changed my elastic positioning twice and still my bite is not closed. They insist on fixing this with elastics to finish me up. Do you think my bite can be fixed with elastics alone or should I request another rescan?

Just the fact that you're trying to close your bite and your current orthodontist hasn't been able to. Don't mention their practices or how long it's been until they give you their input.

They look finished to me too, but my teeth don't touch when I bite down. Cosmetically I'm happy with them, but I also want my bite to be aligned so I dont have issues with my jaw in the future.Omg! My teeth were worse than yours but similar. Im 37/40 Im so sick it it already! Youre a trooper!!I still dont get why it is lasting 5 years. My teeth were far worse, and they look ok now after 9 months. I am now on my first refinements round, they are working on my bite now. You are a trooper like the other commenter said.\\nYour bite looks good to me, just seems like the back teeth are not touching, but that seems to be a common thing from the thickness of the aligners, they will probably settle when you dont wear the aligners all the time in the retainer phase. But I am no ortho, so just guessing. Good luck! Š[deleted]Haha yeah....I'm so over it!5 years is very long but Im not sure what your starting point was? My understanding is a posterior open bite can be a relatively common side effect of having clear aligners. It should be fixed but its not unheard of. My ortho opted to treat mine by cutting my top aligners so they dont cover all of molars, he explained my molars would settle. My past 3 aligners have been this way and my open bite is almost completely closed now. I do think other orthos try to use elastics to achieve this, it really depends on the case I guess. Then there are some Ive seen on here who recommended finishing with traditional braces because of this issue.\\n\\nI would ask to speak to the ortho again directly and ask if elastics is the only way to achieve closing the open bite or if they have another recommendation. \\n\\nI know this doesnt help, but just as a side note, your teeth look phenomenal other than the open bite!Thanks so much. Im really pleased with them cosmetically.  I just wish I could be done with them but the bite is still off. My teeth were crooked but I really don't think they were that bad. Everything was straight except for my two front teeth and they had initially said 18-24 months for treatment. I may ask about traditional braces on my next appointment. This is just getting out of hand ya know?

They had said that I was a candidate for both options,  so I went with the less visible one as I was getting married the next year.

This orthodontist doesn't sound like a good choice. Extraction of one premolar will permanently lock in the asymmetry, is a recipe for TMD and will be far from perfect. Correcting this adequately will require tads and appliances designed to correct asymmetry. You need to find an orthodontist who has lots of experience with asymmetry and will be honest with you that absolute perfection may even require surgery.

Honestly, I had no idea it would take so long, because I thought only a couple teeth moved significantly. \\nI don\\'t know how long it will take after the initial 23.

How long is your treatment plan supposed to last?Delta Dental.

My top fixed aligner is only half there because most of it broke off, so half of my top teeth are perfect and the rest have reverted. Any UK input on this thread would be greatly appreciated as Im starting a new job soon (in the Midlands) and looking for an ortho who can offer monthly instalments to treat this.\\n\\nAlso did anyone with this similar starting issue have to get their bottom aligner removed whilst treatment was ongoing? Or did the ortho keep it on and provide you with only a top tray? Ive always wondered if maybe my existing bottom teeth alignment isnt satisfactory by invisalign standards and therefore Id have to pay for a full set.My understanding is that usually the set is always complete (top+bottom), even in case one of them is passive. However, thats more common toward the end of a set of aligners. Not so much that in all your treatment you won\\'t have any movement in an entire arch ...Your teeth look very similar mine, and we have a similar story (although I had no wire on bottom teeth so mine are obviously much more crooked than yours.)\\n\\nI started Invisalign last month and was given 11 trays total.

Thank you for sharing your story and because you mentioned something about college in DC, and I\\'m a HUSL alum, I feel the need to comment. While I cannot give you advice on how to \"fix\" the midline, I can say that for many of us, we never even knew what a midline was until this group; hence ... the every day citizen will not understand nor care about a midline or the lack thereof. People just want to see and look at straight beautiful teeth, which it seems like you have. I\\'m sorry you are now having insecurities about the end result but would braces have allowed for a midline? Did an ortho tell you that? Honestly, would you really rather have had braces? Hindsight is 20/20 ... it\\'s easy to say that now but I feel that if you did go that route, you would have posted that you then rather had invisalign. From your other post, your teeth look very good. Perhaps after college, and when you enter the job force, you can opt for great dental insurance and see another ortho to work on your midline if it bothers you that much.Regardless of what form of braces you have, you would still have a misaligned midline. For missing a tooth down there, it is perfectly aligned with the 3 teeth. I am in the same boat, with 3 bottom incisors, so they will always be \"off\".Your teeth look great. As the poster above said, no one is ever going to notice your midline. If you have a tooth like an incisor missing, unless you get an implant, you will never have a matching midline top and bottom, regardless of whether you did regular braces or Invisalign. Trying to get a midline with your five remaining canines and incisors would mean your entire lower bite would be off.  I know this because my crowding was so bad and my jaw so small, I had to pull my #26 incisor in order to have a chance at a straight bottom row and dramatically improve my oral health. My ortho said that more important than a midline and I agree.

I picked up the new 44 trays yesterday but he just left them for me at reception even though he was in. I really like him, he responds to emails etc but should he really be seeing me more often or am I just being a bit needy!!!?!! I was hoping to be completely done by the end of this summer but now these trays alone will take me through to next April and I dont want another issue to set me back even more. Thanks in advanceIve literally never met my ortho and Im sort of convinced they arent even real. Just a dentist masquerading as the face of an ortho. Probably why my treatment has been 40 initial trays and 56 refinement trays when all I want is one tooth straitened out and to be done with it. 56 trays and that tooth is more crooked then when I started.I dont know if he œshould\\x9d be seeing you more often.\\n\\nDifferent dentists/orthos run things in different ways and thats their personal choice.\\n\\nHowever if you feel hes not giving you good œcustomer service\\x9d , then maybe mention it politely to the staff at the practice.\\n\\nI personally always want to keep my patients happy and avoid an issue. \\n\\nSome patients want more personal contact than others.I got mine in July and ive only seen mine 3 times too.

Im not seeing him again until May, for another round of IPR. \\n\\nI think its totally normal.Thanks, yeah I guess so its just sometimes my mind starts going into overdrive and I think the realisation of another 14 months was freaking me out a bit and making me question stuff.\\nHope all yours goes well, looking forward to when we all have fabulous smiles xMake sure you're seeing your regular dentist through the process.

You wear them for the 22 hours etcat least yours took new molds, new scan and had trays made according to your updated condition....\\n\\nI lost track of one tooth as well at 25/39, i asked if he could just re scan and make the new sets from there but he said to wear the original to the end and just go back to him when I am around the last sets for a re scan at that point and make sets if needed.... now i just left that country and i might end up with just one tooth bad tracked and the rest fine, which sucks...\\n\\nOn top of that, I had to start modifying my aligners myself in order to fit them properly, since the tooth that didn't track is inclined, the aligner will just press on the tooth down if not corrected... I had to use a hole punch, not the clear aligners one since I did not want to pay for that tool, but a Hole punching device I have for belts and such things... Hole punch the inside of that aligner in the position of the lagging tooth, now it fits almost perfectly.... \\n\\nwearing my aligners for 18 days instead of 14 to try prevent another tooth lagging behind.I only ever see my ortho at the end of every set of trays (had 33 inital trays, just finished 14 refinememts with elastics and need another 12 with IPR) or if I need to go in to replace attachments/metal buttons for my elastics. What I really like though is they gave me this 'scanning box' where I can place my phone and take a picture of my teeth at the end of each week and the ortho confirms if I can switch onto the next tray or keep the current one on for a few more days if a certain tooth isn't tracking properly.that is unknown technology for me, sounds very nice and it is good to hear that your dentist is on your treatment, following up via phone app whatnot.I see my ortho every 6 or 7 weeks. They didnt give me all of my trays up front because they wanted to ensure that all of my teeth were tracking (one actually stopped tracking so he needed to develop a plan for that for my next round of refinements)I see mine monthly and he gives me two new aligners and checks to see that attachments are still in place . I wish it was less often.kind of a hassleyou could tell him that you are going to be very busy, to set your appointments more far apart... but trust me, it is a hassle now but it would be more of a hassle if the dentist didn't care and you end up doing a refinement after refinement.Wow, be happy, mine just sent me off with all my trays and I don't have an appointment for approximately 3 months, I pray everything works and hopefully I would know if it's not working, been reading all Invisalign post for information!I started Invisalign in June and Ive probably seen my ortho 8 times.

In another post in this sub the use of chewies seems to be controversial.

I would use them!Piggybacking on this ” I was told to use chewies to seat my aligners after having them off, but should I be actively using them more through the day too?

As a [severe case](https://old.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/so5c80/2848_and_for_the_first_time_in_my_life_my_lateral/) of crowding with a cross bite i was doubtful myself that Invisalign would work for me, especially as i am in my mid 30s but im so happy with my progress. \\n\\nDo you think Invisalign will eventually overtake traditional metal braces as the most commonly used orthodontic treatment, even for severe cases like mine? And right now do you think there is really any reason to go with traditional braces over Invisalign aside from compliance issues?Traditional braces will always have their place for 2 reasons.\\n1) compliance: most teenagers are not compliant enough for removable appliances and they cant take off fixed braces themselves.\\n2) forces: fixed braces pull whereas aligners push.\\nSome cases will benefit more from one movement than the other, ie they are good at doing different things.How to know if youre tracking correctly? Ive just started my second tray and I dont want any set back for the trays to come so what are the signs to look for to know if everything is tracking correctly?If youve worn the tray for the prescribed time (7-14 days) and the teeth are still not fully inserted into them- ie there is an œair gap\\x9d of 2mm or more between the tip of the tooth and the aligner. \\n\\nAlso If the attachments are not siting roughly in the attachment poroof the trayOk thanks!!Hi! Can your teeth œstretch\\x9d the aligners? I have 6 sets of passive aligners for my top arch and whenever I change to the next one my teeth feel a little tight. Shouldnt they feel the same as the previous passive aligner, and just look fresher?Yes the aligners will stretch and warp if worn for a long period.\\nThe upper teeth may be trying to relapse slightly as well.Interesting! Thank you. I guess thats why they arent used as retainersI have this too. 19 on bottom arch, but only 11 on top, so I have 8 top arch passive aligners, and they leats feel snugger and tighter when changed. I have had the top attachments removed, but the passive  aligners still have all the attachment dimples inhave you got the same?No my attachments are still on but theres only a couple of them. It does feel strange how tight they are when changed but at least they arent mega painfulI finished treatment and had attachments removed and retainers made a few days ago. The retainers are causing me a lot of pain (more than I ever had with my Invisalign trays!) and I know I can file them but I feel like they need to be cut down significantly. Im planning to go into the ortho next week to see what they say, but heres my question: if Im only wearing my retainers about 12 hours a day, will my teeth shift back quickly? How truly necessary is it for an adult to wear retainers post treatment for 22 hrs a day for the first few months? Do some people only wear at night right after and keep their teeth from moving back? Thanks!It depends on the movements your teeth went through. 12 hours a day wear should keep them in place though if youre putting them in nightly. The teeth may shift a little during the day, but the retainer will push them back at nightThanks! Im hoping if they can trim and file the parts that are causing pain (its mainly when I talk w them in and Im a teacher so I talk a lot ‚) Ill then be able to wear them closer to 20 hrs a day. Just dont want to throw away the time, money, and effort I put into the treatment!Absolutely I understand. Have you tried applying a bit of wax (orthowax) to the edge of the retainer?If your teeth are smaller than average, is it harder to close gaps with invisalign/braces?If your teeth are smaller than average and you have gaps, then the issue is that when you close some gaps, other gaps may open up.\\n\\nOften this means that it is necessary to use restorative methods (composite build ups/veneers) to close the spaces.\\n\\nIts easier in dentistry to make small teeth bigger than big teeth smaller!Ã\\x8d went to two different invisalign providers, the first one gave me a timeline of 6 months and second of 12-15months, I understand different dentists give different timelines but I feel like this is a big difference between the two. \\nWhat's your opinion?Go with the one who gives you the longer estimate, youll be less disappointed. I imagine the 6 month huy hasnt considered your case closely enough.Its been 7 months since I finished my 2 year Invisalign treatment to close my big gaps. I know youre supposed to wear a retainer forever, but I know some people only wear theirs at night or a few nights a week after a year or so. \\n\\nI noticed about an hour after I take my retainer out my gap between my two front teeth starts to open up. There was an incident last week where I was sick and forgot to put my retainer in for two days. When I did put them back in I was surprised at how snug they were. It was almost like putting in a new tray for the first time during treatment. The discomfort only lasted a minute however and everything is good now. \\n\\nIs it always going to be like that? Are teeth really constantly trying to revert back to their old positions.\\n\\nI remember the first Ortho I went to recommended metal braces for me and suggested I needed a surgery to cut the frenulum halfway through the treatment. \\n\\nThe second Ortho I went to and did Invisalign through said the surgery wasnt necessary, but now Im wondering if thats why that gap opens up so quickly between the two front teeth.I personally like to place a fixed wire retainer after Ive closed a big gap between teeth, as I find this situation susceptible to relapseWhat's your recommendation if you can't wear a wire? Every doctor I've consulted said I couldn't have a wire due to my anatomy. I'm afraid my teeth will always relapse without itIf you cant wear a wire (sounds like youre gonna snitch on the mob!) then get viveras and wear them for at least 12 hours/day for a yearI'm not the dentist but I know from others that if the gap is constantly trying to reopen you most likely need a frenectomy to see if it will stop. If not, you may need a bonded retainer in addition to plastic retainers to keep it closed.\\n\\nI would go back to the orthodontist and communicate this to them and ask for a referral for a frenectomy.[deleted]Maybe. Perhaps you should go back to your dentist and check.Should my provider have reattached attachments after around 6 fell off on my first night? 1 fell off while getting my first aligner fitted (so immediately after they were applied)\\n\\nHe said it was no big deal as some are more important than others and they didn't need to be redone, just to make sure to use a chewy for half an hour daily, but it's basically all of my top teeth, I've gone for weeks feeling like my aligners are essentially sliding off.I personally tell my patients not to worry if one or 2 fall of, unless its on a crucial tooth which requires a lot of movement. 6 however sounds like quite a lot.\\n\\nWhen I see my patients at review Ill rebond the attachments, however I dont ask them to come in as an emergency for lost attachments.\\n\\nIf youre in additional aligners/refinements, then chances are the attachments are less crucial.I am now waiting my first clincheck, but just after seeing me for the very first time a few months ago (I removed 4 wisdom teeth on the meantime) my ortho told me the treatment will be about one year long (to be confirmed) with 14 days changes.\\nHe was talking like 14 days its the standard, but I now believe that the majority of the Reddit Invisaligners change trays every 7 days.\\nDo you think it is a general personal preference of my ortho (very experienced one) or something specifically related to my case?\\nIs there any advantages for longer intervals? \\nThank you in advance!Its partly personal preference, but other factors affect the rate of tray turnover: age of patient, difficulty of movements, gum health. \\n\\nId follow your orthos advice. Better to do the process more slowly but predictably.Thank you! I will definitely follow his advice in any case.\\nIt was just a curiosity, since I thought having twice the amount of trays, but with half the frequency should technically be the same, but a little bit more hygienic/practical (lesser staining..) and easier (less œfirst day\\x9d pain)If it helps any, I wear mine for 14 days and don't have staining. Soak your trays when they are out of your mouth for meals/teeth brushing (e.g., jar with lid if at work) *I never let mine dry, rinse your mouth/remove stained-saliva if eating stain-causing foods and drinks, brush your trays+teeth, floss. Can use a sonic cleaner. I haven't used mine very often as I don't notice a difference (no staining happening), so I just use it for hygiene intentions instead since I already bought it.Can you explain how each of these factors affects the prescribed time?The older you are, the slower teeth move, the more difficult the movement, the slower to achieve, if theres a worry about historic perio (gum) health it can be wise to ask for slower movements.\\n\\nTheres a few other factors tooHi there. Im now at the end and at the wire retainer thing behind the teeth. What would you say is the best way to clean them and the teeth as flossing isnt an option now. Thank you!\\n\\nPs, cant recommend Invisalign highly enough!Either tepees or similar interdental brushes or superfloss.Thank you!My ortho said hed suggest for me a combo of the fixed wire retainer + Vivera. \\n\\nIs it easy to remove the wire bonded retainer at any point, and if yes, would I be able to use the same Vivera trays or would I have to buy new plastic retainers too? I hear theyre a bit pricey and people change them yearly because of that.Its easy enough for the dentist to remove the fixed wires yes. The vivera would still fit if you took the wires off afterWhat about a water flosser?Im not a big fan, but theyre better than nothingConsidering getting a Waterpik for that very reason!The combo waterpik + toothbrush is amazingMy orthodontist said that when I completely finish my treatment, that I will only need to wear the retainer at bedtime. Not during the day. Ive read a lot of orthodontist websites, and on this Reddit, that you must wear them all day and at night after Invisilign treatment.\\nWill wearing my retainer only at night be ok? Theres too much conflicting info on the internet!It depends on your case. Trust your orthodontistThank you for answering, and  I do trust her, But Im curious as to why the info varies so muchwould you tell a patient to only wear them at bed time?Because every case is different. \\n\\nIf one of my patients has fixed wire retainers and didnt have significant expansion of the back teeth, then yes I might say night time only is okThank you so much for your time on this thread! Answering a lot of questions.My opinion is to trust your body - your teeth will tell you if you need to wear the retainers more often if they are sore, or the retainers are painful or very tight. Not sure if you've ever gone a long period during a day without wearing a tray and felt any of this - but if it feels like that then you need to wear them more.\\n\\nMost orthodontists tell their patients the same thing with wearing retainers but we're all different and our teeth move at different rates.Hi, please answer this bc Im so curious. Im on tray 1, change weekly. I tried on tray 6 to see if they fit. They do fit my teeth easily. Does it mean mu teeth dont move at all during 6 weeks?Thats not a typical Invisalign situation, but the plastic in the trays is quite flexible and your dentist may have only prescribed small movements for the first 6 trays. \\n\\nHow many trays total in your course of treatment?There are 30 trays. I got traditional braces but wasnt happy with the result so he put me on Invisalign to tip the teeth out, making my jaw wider.I notice a film on the inside of my alligners, even if I brush them twice a day. Whats happening here and how do I clean them? I think my aligners are stinky in the morning when I wake up. What can I soak it in to get œfresh\\x9d feeling aligners. I brush my teeth abt 5 times a day and brush my aligners twice a day; I also need to go in with a q tip to clean the aligners.Not OP but I use ultrasonic cleaner where I immerse aligners (or other objects to clean) in water and ultrasound cleans them like no other means (sorry for my English)Yes! So much easier and sparkling clean.Oh ok, I have one of those. U use just wanter?YesSame here, I use the Dental Pod ultrasonic cleaning systemRetainer briteWhen you take your aligners out, put them in water. What makes them get gross is letting them dry out when they come off. Some people add a little dish soap when they soak them but I found I cant get the taste of soap out. I just put them in water and brush them every time before I put them back in if I can. Theres also a foam cleaner you can use that cleans them as you are wearing them if you want to look into that. But its kind of expensiveThanksMix water and hydrogen peroxide together in a cup. When I take out my trays in the morning when I wake up and at night while eating dinner, I put them in the cup to soak for awhile.  Rinse them off or brush them before putting them back in. It keeps them clean.ThanksI am not able to visit my dentist one month and a half after my last tray to remove attachments and get a permanent retainer - is it alright I just wear the last tray for that time?Yes that will hold the teeth in position. I often have my patients wear the last try to retain things for up to a month.Whats the average total cost for a patient?In the UK I think that the average costs are between Â2K and Â4K, plus extra potential costs for retention and cosmetic amendments at finishThank you for your answer!I'm a few trays away from finishing my treatment but have suddenly noticed a sharp shooting pain that lasts a couple seconds when I drink water on one of my teeth/gum around it. (Just sometimes, not all the time) Since I'm seeing my dentist in a couple weeks anyway should I just leave it or should I ring and ask to be seen? Worried it could be the start of a receding gum or root damage. It's the tooth next to one of my teeth that's done a fair amount of movement, (elastics, it was a tooth that was pushed behind and is now being bought forward) the gum only looks slightly damaged.It could be recession, or possibly the tooth is a little sensitive due to the orthodontic movement. I would suggest using sensodyne (or a similar toothpaste) and just mention it to your dentist at the next routine checkHi! Does each aligner on the journey move my teeth at the same pace or are there some aligners that will have more impact than others ? \\n\\nIm basically wondering if the teeth shifting is constant over time or if I can expect bigger transformation a some pointThe latter is usually true. Also sometimes the tooth position will seem to get worse before it gets better. It depends on how your dentist has programmed your clinicheck.Thanks !How much of the payment the client makes stays with you and how much goes to Invisalign?The lab bill we pay to Invisalign varies depending on how many cases we do per year. If I do enough cases then my discount may go up to 50%.\\n    Lot of dentists will charge double or triple the Invisalign lab fee, but bear in mind that the overheads in running a dental practice are highIve had braces before (8-10y ago) and probably my roots have shortened due to braces treatment; now when doing Invisalign, my doctor refuses to get my changes down from 3 weeks to 2 weeks as they are afraid for root resorption. What are the chances for this and would fortnightly changes be possible as Invisalign should not be that harsh as traditional braces?Maybe. The risk is certainly lower with Invisalign, but it seems reasonable for your doctor to take extra precautions do you not think?I do agree, at the same time I have never heard of three weeks changes. Thank you for your input and for answering everyones questions!I was on three week changes and only moved to two weeks when I could show my teeth had adjusted to each new aligner by the seventh day. I have a pretty severe case, not sure if that influences it.thank you for sharing!Hi, super interesting post, thanks Op!\\n\\nSo my question is for an overbite, does Invisalign bring your top teeth back or move the bottom ones forward? Or both? Does moving your bottom teeth forward involve your jaw moving in some way?\\n\\nThanks!No problem!\\n\\nInvisalign can do a bit of both, but I would be aiming to mostly retract the upper top teeth to correct an over jet (I assume thats what you mean).\\n\\nIn a adult were not really making the jaw itself grow or move especiallyCan Invisalign be used to correct the bite (specifically for minimal overbite), or would conventional metal braces be preferable?It depends on the individual case, but yes Invisalign can do this. Sometimes it can be more easily achieved with fixed braces however.Thanks! Hoping to avoid train tracks round 2, but lets see thenDefinitely not a professional, but I have Invisalign to fix a mild overbite and a few other minor issues and it is working so well and so quickly!Thank you! Thats good to know. Mine is pretty mild, so I have hope nowYes!! If your ortho said that its possible, then it probably is. My brother just finished his treatment and his overbite was worse than mine (not bad, but worse) and his teeth/bite are totally perfect nowIll get some consults lined up soon to get a few opinions from orthos. A little annoyed my previous ortho only focused on getting my teeth perfect and not the bite. But anyway, its still better than what I started out withYeah thats very annoying. Do you mean that you had a consult and they only focused on straightening your teeth, or you already had treatment and they only focused on the teeth not the bite,That I had two years of braces and they mainly just focused on straightening the teeth. My dentist kept going on about how my overbite made me look more youthful, when I just wanted to look normal and am not into having an overbite just to œbe youthful\\x9d. It was a little odd\\n\\nEdit: and subsequent dentists have told me my bite is off still and needs correcting.Holy, thats so frustrating especially given that an overbite isnt only aesthetic, it can also be a very real health problem. Well I hope that youre able to fix this issue with Invisalign! I have faith :)Thanks! Me too. It was all the cleaning that I couldnt stand with conventional braces all over again. Im such a snackerUnfortunately Invisalign is definitely also tough for snackers too, and theres lots of cleaning involved. Im not a snacker so its been really easy for me to wear my trays 20+ hours, but cleaning the trays is something that I loathe hahaIm only halfway through my treatment (overbite, overjet and severe crowding) and my bite has shifted dramatically. My jaw is noticeably further forward.Thanks, thats good to know. I had conventional metal braces and it did shift my jaw forwards, but my ortho seemed a bit obsessed with keeping my œchildlike\\x9d (her words) overbite to an extent and seemed worried Id hate the result if she moved my jaw much further forwards. Subsequent dentists have commented that my lower jaw still needs to come forwards a bit, so Im wondering about getting braces again for thisCan invisalign be used in conjunction with a hyrax expander post-SARPE?Im sorry Im not familiar with a Hyrax expander, or the acronym SARPE?Is the adjustment per tray linear? It feels like my earlier ones were big adjustments and my later ones are hardly changing my teeth but it could be just perceptionSome trays are doing more movements than others. It is entirely dependent on how the dentist has programmed your clinicheck> SARPE\\n\\nSurgically Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion.Ok thanks!My dentist sent me to Endodontist midway though Invisalign treatment and now they are recommending removing one tooth (upper last one from the left #15). How fucked am I? I am 2 weeks from being done but need to get permanent retainers made. Do I wait with removal, remove and get fitted or remove, get a prosthetic tooth and get fitted?This question is a bit beyond the scope of what I can answer here. Best to talk to your own dentist.I'm considering Invisalign treatment but I may be moving to another country by the end of the year. Is it possible to continue my treatment in another country with another Invisalign specialist or should I wait to move to start my treatment?Theoretically possible, but I would advise it. Wait until youre settled in your new country.Thank you for the adviceInvisalign and short roots? Bad idea or depends on the situation?Generally not the best idea, but it depends on how short and how much movementWas told I have level one movement but my roots are short but not that short, thanks!I have 100% overbite and my dentist said she can fix it without attachments. Im on tray 2 of 13 but dont see how that can happen with just trays. Is that possible? My before and after simulation is on my post history.I personally think you need attachments. Is it actually Invisalign youre having, or is it another system like smile direct club?Its a Canadian brand called SureCure. My dentist sees me every month and gives me 3 trays at a time. I have to wear each tray for 2 weeks.Fair enough. I still think you need attachmentsIs a pregt woman more at risk for tooth loss while doing Invisalign?If theres the slightest chance of tooth loss being caused by Invisalign treatment, a responsible dentist would either\\nA) not provide it \\nB) heavily consent you for that possibilitywhat if a woman doing invisalign treatment while not losing any teeth becomes pregt?If youve got a fairly healthy mouth, becoming pregt should have little effect on the Invisalign treatment. In fact it might actually make it more successful as hormonal changes can make the bone softer so the teeth move more easily.Thank you!!!Is this applicable also for breastfeeding women?Shouldnt matter at all, but juggling Invisalign and a young baby will be hard workThanks for your reply, I d say impossible :DIs this your first child? Theres a saying between women that youll always lose a tooth with every chid. For some reason theres a high correlation that a lot of women either need to have a root canal / tooth pulled / or their wisdom teeth come in. Ive needed to have a root canal every time I got pregt. For some reason the root gets inflamed and the pain is unbearable.2 questions: \\n\\n1.Do you have to wait after eating for ur enamel? My dentist told me I can brush right away.\\n\\n2. When Im done with my treatment I heard you either get retainers or a metal wire on ur teeth forever, which is better? I have gaps that Im closing up so which one would keep them closed better?If youre drinking something acidic, then I would not brush straight awayOk and my other question is when Im done with my treatment I heard you either get retainers or a metal wire on ur teeth forever, which is better? I have gaps that Im closing up so which one would keep them closed better?Everyone should get retainers. The metal wire isnt as important for everyone, but in a spacing case, I would suggest itOk thanksMy overcorrecting retainer pushed my inner teeth together a bit ” I now have a fixed wire and permanent retainer. Can I do anything to reverse this? Like going back to my older Invisalign trays? Or would I need to get refinements againYoull need to get refinements again \\nOr have the fixed wire removed and see if the teeth relapse themselves slightlyCould you please explain the purpose of elastics and how they work? I'm due to get mine fitted soon with the attachments, and struggling to understand how they will make a difference if they just seem to connect the top and bottom trays together. Thanks for doing this!Elastics apply pulling forces while aligners provide pushing forces.\\n\\nI think the type of elastics youre describing are providing an extra force to either pull back the upper or lower front teeth.Gotcha, that makes perfect sense! I've got an overbite so they probably need to be pulled back just like you said. Thank you!Is Vivera and Fixed Invisalign Retainers required after finishing the refinement phase?\\n\\nWhich one is more important can I skip one?\\n\\nCost of retainers (Vivera/Metal) is 550 USD / 500 EUR / 420 GBPViveras are an optional , superior, upgrade to the standard plastic œEssix retainer\\x9d. I like them, but theyre not necessarily essential.\\n\\nBonded wire retainers are very helpful if your tooth movements are at high risk of relapse (spacing, rotations, severe crowding)Thanks Doc for your words.\\n\\nI think i will just pay for the whole package and get the best that system can offer.what's the difference of going to you or an ortho?The main reason patients choose to have treatment with me rather than going to an ortho, is cos Ive been looking after their/their kids general dentistry for years so they know and trust me already rather than going to see a new person.  \\n\\nThe other reason is that because Im experienced in restorative work and orthos dont do any, it can be easier to have the same person straighten the teeth and then do the cosmetic work to finish it off.\\n\\nI dont take on all cases however. If its too complex, then I send on to my local orthodontistthanks for the answer and it was what I was actually thinking....\\n\\nwent to my dentist who didn't like the look of the amount of IPR the sim recommended, so they passed me onto an ortho..\\n\\nI have to hop between both now though as I has crown and restoration work to get done..An attachment fell off and my dentist said I didn't need it and that they overplan the attachments. Said it won't make any difference. Is this trueWill it correct a bite and/or help TMJ? Im very confident Invisalign is the reason I developed TMJ 10 years ago and my current dentist is offering it as the solution to my messed up biteIf youve got TMJ issues, you might need splint therapy before starting on Invisalign[deleted]The honest answer is: often were not sure, so you might either over estimate the length to manage your patients expectations, or you may underestimate to try and tell them what they want to hear.\\n\\nTheres a lot of variables which can slow the process downMy orthodontist did the same thing, but said the offset was to account for a certain number of refinement trays. Sure enough, when my initial 24 were up I had a few spots that needed addressing and I was given an addition 12 trays which is putting me at my original 9 month estimate. Now Im just hoping my next 6 trays finish the job and I dont need another round.I struggle with compliance.

Ive been struggling with my mental health for years now, and in the middle, when I was feeling better, I made the decision to get Invisalign. However I finally got them today, and Im on the verge of having a panic attack. Why did I do this to myself? Why did I sign up for 15-18 months of this? I cant remember why I made this decision right now, all I feel is anxiety and intense self-hatred.You get used to it so quick! And it flies by, I too felt overwhelmed and it pissed me off initially but god it was so worth it, one of the best things Ive ever doneThis gives me some hope.I freaked out when I got them at first too because it was a whole commitment! Extra cleaning and time that I had to have them in, but honestly it fits right in. They dont cause that much discomfort later down the road and they become second nature to take care of. I hope everything is ok, and I wish you the best for your Invisalign Journey!! \\x9dï¸\\x8fYeah it becomes second nature, honestly.what chloe said. its super uncomfortable and makes you want to rip out the aligner and quit right now. but give it a week or two and itll get a lot easier. im halfway through my trays and its almost second nature to use my aligners. \\n\\nim sorry its feeling really hard right now, and i wish i could do something to relieve that for you. please just try to be patient and itll get betterI like the pain of a new traysaaaameYep, 6 months in and they flew by. Give it a week or two and you\\'ll probably prefer having them in.Ive been having the exact same problem and aside from a rough start it helped me with my mental health immensely; important is that you push yourself in the beginning. \\n\\nDue to depression I used to have the hardest time taking care of myself. I rarely brushed my teeth, never showered, the usual. With Invisalign and being forced to take care of myself everything improved a 7473882 % (including my mental health).\\n\\nStay strong these first days and dont surrender. Youll get through this.Same. I kind of needed a new routinesame it helped so much for the routine aspectI also had huge buyers remorse but that goes away within the first week or so haha.\\n\\nIts typical to think œoh shit what did I get myself in to?\\x9d \\n\\nIm now 7 weeks in and the difference in my teeth already is nuts, Im so happy and excited to finish out treatment TBH. Just hang in there. Itll get better trust me.\\n\\nMost of it is self guided as well, you swap your own trays etc. Metal braces wouldve been a much bigger commitment to the orthodontists office!Agreed. The first week, maybe first 2 weeks were the worst ones. After that, you barely notice them, except when you change out for the next set. That only is noticeable for like, the first day max. They\\'re really quite painless and nobody notices you wearing them. Back when I had mine in, my coworkers were always surprised to see me pull mine out at lunch. Literally every time they\\'re like \"oh yea I forgot you were doing that\".\\n\\nThey\\'re a small price to pay for a much more comfortable and aesthetically pleasing smile.Same - just over 3 months in and loving it now. It did take a while tho.I almost had a panic attack when they put the attachments on and I was freaking out the whole first week. But now Im really used to it! You got this :)The attachments were intense! That was a rough appointment for me too. Im super sound sensitive and it was torturous. Glad youre feeling better now!Oh no! Is it loud? Ill bring ear plugs if so”I usually always have a pair in my purse anyway, because like you, I hate noisy places and am protective of my hearing”and its paid off, as I have great hearing for my age.Applying them wasnt too bad it was when they shaped them and then later in the process the IPR was also terrible. Grinding/polishing sounds that felt like they were inside my head. I keep earplugs in my purse too! Im soooo sound-sensitive. And it doesnt help that my partner has the loudest speaking voice on the planet. I swear he has made my hearing worse lolUgh I know right? I had the same immediate reaction. But I stay focused on the outcome I want and how much better Ill feel about myself. Similar mentality to working out”I know I need to do it, some days its really hard to force myself to do it, and I almost always feel better about it. Im only a few months in but can tell you the œinconvenience\\x9d feeling fades quickly, it became second nature within a week. \\n\\nHang in there! Youre making a difficult but positive investment in your future.Thank you, I needed this motivation. Right now Im just hating myself a little because Im so uncomfortable, and feel like I just imposed this on myself. \\n\\nCant wait for the first week to be over *sigh*Just get through that first week. After that, youll be more comfortable with it and youll start seeing results. Itll be worth it!I disliked the strange uncomfortable feeling as well. I ordered some silicone sensory/toddler chews from Amazon. Chewing on those really help me. Ive had aligners for several months and now only very sporadically get that feeling.I\\'m on week 4. You get used to it. But you do tend to skip meals as you don\\'t want the burdenHey there, I felt the same way the day I got mine on. My teeth were mostly ok as I previously had braces, Im doing Invisalign only about 9 months, but when I walked out of the ortho office I was very upset, I got home and my wife was like how do you feel? And i said œdepressed.\\x9d Why did I do something so drastic thats such a big lifestyle change? My teeth were fine!!\\n\\nHowever, like some others have said, you quickly get used to it. Sure its an adjustment, but trust me, in 3 weeks or so you will be in the groove, and you also get to watch your teeth improve!\\n\\nHang in there and good luck!!Solid rhymeI felt the same exact way when I first started, literally had a panic attack and felt claustrophobic bc it felt so odd. But you get used to them I swear! It look me like 2 weeks, then I barely noticed they were in. Kinda becomes like second nature. Plus I feel like seeing your progress, moving to a new tray each week, and keeping up with my flossing and brushing actually helped me out so much. I also struggle with mental health, but I swear I would do invisalign all over again because Im so happy with the results :) you got this!I felt claustrophobic too!  I would need to remove them periodically and take a mini break and then put them back in. It took me 5 weeks before I had moments of them feeling so natural that I couldnt remember if they were in or out. Its nice to know that Im not the only one who felt claustrophobic.Been there done that lol. The first day was the worst for me. First day I was in denial. First week I regretted the whole decision. You need to get used to the whole transition. By the second week you will be fine. Just go out and do stuff, or go fix and clean something in the house. And when u see the change in your teeth you will start wondering why you didnt do it sooner. Im getting refinements and I cant wait to do a whitening session and be done with this. Good luck. Its 100000% worth it!I was miserable the first few days and was low-key pissed at my wife for talking me into doing it.  The pain goes away although there may be some discomfort with your teeth moving.  It really becomes a way of life and you feel strange when they\\'re not in.  \\n\\nTry to remember why you got that in the first place.  I know it\\'s hard at the moment but it absolutely gets better and you\\'ll be so happy with the results.I\\'m poor as hell, but I still dropped the 7k on mine. I\\'m on tray 38/50 right now, and I can tell you that I have no regrets. I feel so much more confident when I smile, and I know my teeth are going to be healthy for the rest of my life. You got this OP! It may seem scary at first but you\\'ll be thanking yourself in the future.suffer now (as in the first week or two) and live the rest of your life as a champion.You get used to wearing them quick, and look through some of the results here, they can move so fast and it will bring you so many benefits. \\n\\nMaybe reframe it as gratitude \"I am grateful that I get to fix my teeth/bite and that this system allows me to eat all and it\\'s so flexible. I\\'m grateful I get to engage in this treatment and that my brain is trying to take care of me in all areas\" riding the wave and acknowledging my feelings and reframing them as gratitude is what helps me when I feel anxious.\\n\\nAlso, remember your coping skills: deep breathing, journaling, gratitude, reading or watching something distracting, taking a shower. Remind yourself you are safe and that millions of people have done it and there is always an improvement. You got this.Damn good advice.Brilliant suggestions, thank youWhen I first got my Invisalign in my first thoughts were œoh yeah, I cant do this, no way\\x9d \\n\\nAnyway I have three trays left lolIt\\'s going to help your mental health in the long run. Stick with it. It\\'s too late now. There are no refunds. You\\'re along for the ride. And your smile is going to be radiant. You\\'ve ***got*** this.Omg that could have been written by me. I felt the same, including almost having a panic attack. Now I\\'m on tray 14 and totally fine. Please don\\'t give up <3The first week is the worst, and once you get through that, it honestly feels more of a routine and less of a burden. I also have anxiety issues and sometimes Invisalign actually helps me feel like Im in control and making positive changes (and I can channel anxiety stress into aggressive chewy use which helps keep my progress up).Same. With anxiety, you can feel like you don\\'t have enough control, but with invisalign, it\\'s like, \"ok, *this* is going to get better, at least. I\\'m taking steps to fix my smile and it *will* get there.\"It may feel like that now, but push through! i just started tray 16 and i am actually enjoying the fact im progressing and my mouth looks/feels a lot better!I was the same! On day 2, I remember reading comments in this sub that were like \"the first week is hard, but 2 weeks later you won\\'t even notice your aligners anymore and you\\'ll forget to take them out before meals sometimes\" I said THERE IS NO WAY. And then 2 weeks later, there I was, not noticing my aligners at all. I\\'m on tray 9 out of 21, starting to see progress, and I am so happy and proud of myself for doing this. We\\'re all going to have the teeth of our dreams! And smile with our mouths open! WOOHOO! You\\'ve got this.This is me rn!! Im only on day 5, projected 21 week plan but ortho said to expect closer to a year. The first 3 days were the worst - still have pain and cant chew much but its much better already. Looking forward to hopefully seeing some results around week 10!!I feel you. The first days are awful. I personally was going through a deep depression. However, I decided that a good step to overcome it was to work on myself so I started invisalign. It hurt a lot the first days but it gets better fast and the next trays didn\\'t hurt as much. Some things that have helped are drinking cool water, an electric toothbrush, sensodyne and GUM flossers.I\\'m about 4 weeks in. I had a few panics in the first few days with discomfort and I struggled to get the trays off. It\\'s all good now though and I\\'m seeing some progress even though very small. I can easily floss between some teeth where I struggled before. It gives me hope. ‚The first weeks are exponentially worse than later weeks.  It gets better though always obviously more annoying than not having them but you\\'ll have a straighter teeth in the endI felt the same way at first . Times going to pass anyway might as well have straight teeth at the end. It\\'s so easy now I wish I would have done it sooner. I\\'m on tray 19 now .I\\'m on tray 10/46 and my teeth already look way better than when I started. After the first couple trays you barely notice any discomfort when putting a new one inOof, it wasn\\'t this way for me at all.  My ortho was aggressive as hell.  20+ attachments and 10 trays from crossbite to straight. Every tray hurt.  Friday was change day, and it\\'d be Tuesday before I stopped groaning every time I put them in.\\n\\nI\\'m glad I did it. So glad.  But it was a chore.I am on biweekly changes because I didn\\'t want to pay $500 extra for that v-pro thing, even though it would bump me up. Maybe I will change my mind...Whats the V-Pro thing? 1st tray user here ‚It is a vibrating device you bite down on for a few min each night that supposedly encourages your teeth to move faster.\\n\\nThis sub has really mixed feelings on it. [Link to a thread discussing this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/c9zgwj/is_the_vpro5_worth_it/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)I felt the same way but now I can tell you that I barely feel them! It\\'s gotten soooo much easier, hang in there!The first week is awful. But by week three or four, I became accustomed to it.I\\'ve had invisalign for 8 months now, I feel like this was one of the best decisions that I made. Your smile will be beautiful, keep your head up :)I had immediate buyer\\'s remorse, too! It really does get better. I would say by 2 weeks in, I felt much more comfortable and less regret-filled! I\\'m about 6 months in now and it all just becomes a new habit and doesn\\'t feel like such an inconvenience. Of course, it will be awesome to be done with it all, but I don\\'t find it takes up so much brain space anymore.They\\'re soo annoying the first few weeks lol. Now I can barely feel them in my mouth. I work with consultations and I apologized for a week because I felt I was speaking funny.Totally can relate. I am just three weeks in and while I have gotten very used to it and it doesn\\'t bother me as much, I too freak out when I change a tray and it alters my mouth structure. I\\'m sure I am being super sensitive and no one else can notice it but right now I have this top duck lip thing and I am wondering why the heck I am putting myself through this. I can honestly say that it does get better, but you\\'re going to have to give it time. \\n\\n(Hi Five) We got this!Being in this group has helped me see the \\'final product\\' and I want those beautiful teeth. I know I won\\'t magically be confident but once the Invisalign is done, I know I will feel so much better. Even if it\\'s just smiling at other\\'s when passing them in the park or ordering coffee at starbucsk!I think everyone goes through this. I had a lot of discomfort at first and struggled with eating and cleaning. I felt like it took over my whole life. But quickly it got better and then got even better as time went on. You got this. Yes it will be a struggle at first but it will get better and you will be so happy with your teeth when you finish! It will be worth it! \\x9dï¸\\x8f coming to this subreddit helped me when I had questions or wanted to know if others struggled with the same thing.I had bruxism because of my anxiety and was always bitting my own teeth during the day. I got invisalign not because of my teeth alignment, they are mostly straight, but because of my anxiety. For the first time in 2 years I feel relaxed, I find them conforting. Give them a shot and give yourself a break. This is a good thing you are doing to yourself :)Thats one of the reasons I decided to get them too! Because Im always clenching or grinding my teeth, because of anxiety, my teeth and jaw are always so uncomfortable. I figured it would be a bonus if, in addition to straight teeth, I could also break that habit. Thanks for sharing this, it makes me more optimistic.Everyone feels that way the first week. Pretty much everyone at least considers just throwing the money away and quitting. It\\'ll pass and you\\'ll be glad you stuck with it.It becomes a part of your routine really quickly.  \\nWhen you start to see the results, your confidence will go through the roof and youll remember why you committed to positive self care.The first 2 days suck and I regreted it majorly. After a week it not too bad. Now I\\'m just over 2 weeks in and it\\'s easy, I can take my liners out in about 20 seconds and my new trays were only uncomfortable for about 24 hours.Ha. Thats to the word exactly my situation. Im on day 3 and its feeling a little bit more manageable. Take it day by day OP! It does get betterI just got my invisalign this morning aswell and I\\'m already going crazyIts not even the pressure or pain thats getting to me, but the sheer discomfort of having an alien object in my mouth. Its making my mouth so dry, my upper lip feels like its protruding, I keep lisping, and I know all of this will go away with time and Ill get used to it, but its just alienating and uncomfortable right now.Yeah I can relate, especially with the dry lips, that was the worst part for me. The lisp went away quicklyYea I don\\'t mind the pressure it\\'s just all that you listedI understand. Im on aligner 14 of 18 and I still have days when I feel like throwing the aligners in the trash. Sorry I am not much help but feel like you do and empathize. Hopefully you will be one of the many people who gets used to the aligners.I just got mine put on 3 days ago. I felt the exact same way the first day. Absolute dread. Im by no means feeling œused to it\\x9d yet. But its growing on me. \\nThe first meal - there was no way I could get them out. I was panicking and starving! Then I started eat any my cheeks were getting mangled, and my teeth were killing me. Horrible start. \\nIve since planned my meals better and what Im going to eat. That has helped a lot. \\nI also bought some Colgate Wisps to keep on me in case I eat while away from home. \\nIm still not good at removing the trays, but Im getting there. Slowly learning to live with it. \\n\\nI guess once I see some progress Ill be more motivated. \\nHang in there bud! You got this!It gets so much easier. I got home on day 1 everything felt fine then suddenly I wanted to take them out to eat and I couldnt get them over the attachments without causing pain and I was in an instant panic. But just 2 days later i was popping them out with ease and everything has been great since. One of the best choices I have ever made.I can totally relate I started crying as I walked home from my first appointment but it does get better! I promise!It gets easy fast!!! You will be so happy with the results that it will all be worth it in the end\\x81Youll be glad you made this investment down the line. Its also a low stakes way to learn just how adaptable you really are!Im on DAY 6! I HATED the first day and felt regret while I was in the chair and while I attempted taking it off. I started smiling and taking pics and I already like how I smile! Feels kinda peaceful knowing Im only going to eat within an hour and just finish two big meals a day. Im a little afraid of how Ill feel after I switch trays for the first time but, just seems like Ill just have to prepare myself to do nothing that day so I can just stay in bed and sleep off the pain LOL. This sub was pretty good by leading me into the direction of having a clear mind tbhI havent had any real pain when I switch aligners. The new one may feel tight but its more of a pressure. I read a suggestion to change your aligner before you go to bed and that helps a lot.I expected to have buyers remorse but i dont. Its been a breeze and a slight inconvenience at most. It also helps me keep my overeating in check!\\n\\nLook at it this way, in 15-18 months you will either have the smile you want, or you wont. Try to think about the positives about it (less eating, better oral health, perfect smile,etc.) instead of the negative aspects on it.\\n\\nCongrats on doing something for yourself towards your own self improvement!Totally normal! Not going to lie, depending on your case it may take months for you to notice improvements (took me at least four). I definitely felt the same way you describe, it will pass with time, just don\\'t give up!Dont ! I promise!!! Youll be so happy you did, once you start seeing progress and movement its all worth it! You wont regret it! I understand the remorse thing and I thought omg what did I get myself into when I paid and the day of my life changing self love journey, but you will get thru this !!!!Four weeks in as of yesterday. Youll feel better soon.Its not that bad. Youll see, I had the same panic the first days, but youll get used to it :)Itll will give you something positive to look forward to: every tray change, every subtle change in your look.I was in a similar place when I started but to he honest its already helped my mental health so much to know I was proactively dealing with something that was stupid and causing me so much unnecessary stress.\\n\\nThis is a worthwhile investment. I promise. :)-The first couple of months were rough. My teeth felt hot and sweaty. After that I forgot they were in. Now I feel weird without it.I felt the same way initially, I just wanted to rip these ugly things out of my mouth!! Like everyone else has said though, it will pass. There will be days though where some trays are just so tight and annoying but waaay more manageable than the first time.  It helped on these days for me to do mindless activities the, like cleaning the bathroom, scrubbing my shoes, repotting my plants, anything that keeps both your hands and mind busy.I felt the same! Especially when in pain after the first day, which doesnt last btw!!! \\nIm 4 months in now and Ive gotten so used to them. You obviously want your teeth fixed. Just remember in 15 months youll be done. Time goes by fast.I felt the exact same way once I finally committed. Now I\\'m 8 months in, and I\\'m honestly kind of indifferent about being finished. It\\'s exciting and all, but the discomfort and feelings of inconvenience already fizzled out, and now taking care of them is just another thing I do. Like peeing or taking out my contacts. Also, I smile at myself in the mirror now, which is probably awesome for the mental health thing.You stop thinking about it after like a week. Hang in there :)You did this to get better and to fix your health! This is a major self love act! I got Invisalign 3 weeks ago and not a day goes by without me swearing ( can\\'t snack, can\\'t drink coffee when I want to, rubber band keeps snapping off, discomfort) but in the long run, I am doing this for myself, finally! It does take a lot of discipline and self control but that is a good thing! Just think about the final result. I am on aligner 2 and already notice a small difference in my bite and my bottom teeth. Hang on in there! You\\'re doing the right thing!I literally got my trays on Monday and felt the same! Like what did I commit to... Fast forward to today- I forget theyre even in sometimesI had this same problem at first. I would break down and cry and say I couldnt do this and didnt know what I was getting into but stick with it!!!I was scared too at the beginning. Immediate regret especially since I didnt know I was going to get brackets (which arent invisible). But honestly most people dont notice, even in pictures. Its a little inconvenient but its made me be more conscious of my oral hygiene (flossing 2x/day, before it was like every other week?), and less snacking. And Im already seeing big results and Im like 1/2 way through. The pain is a lot less than braces and even when I lost my retainer, my orthodontist was able to replace it in less than a week.3 weeks and then you\\'ll be happy.I had lingual braces about 12 years ago and  I lasted 3 days. Cost me a fortune but once I had them in I absolutely knew they would be awful for my mental state and probably give me an eating disorder to boot. \\n\\nOver time I started to wish I\\'d stuck with it and bit the Invisalign bullet last year. The fact that you can take the trays out makes such a difference, and that\\'s what sold me on it - but actually you probably won\\'t want to take them out as your mouth feels better with them in! But just knowing you can whip them out makes all the difference. As others have said, just keep on going. There is so much support here, so shout if you need us.The day I got mine I completely panicked too and felt instant regret feeling that I couldnt do this for months\\n\\nNow its been over a year and my treatment is completed in a couple of weeks.  its like time flew by :) \\n\\nYoull get through this!SAME!!!! but I got over it!!!You will get used to it! I felt the same. But eventually I saw the progress my teeth made and now I thank myself everyday I stuck with it! You got this!!! Its worth it my friend.I also felt the same immediately but within about 3-4 days the discomfort went away and it was effortless. I had 48 original trays, and on 12 refinements now, it\\'s been a breeze after the initial \\'oh shit\\' period.I almost cried my first day, just trying to eat with these attachments on my teeth. LOL. You get used to it in no time. You got this!The time is going to pass anyway, might as well be improving your quality of life while it passes.Omg I remember feeling this way! You described it so well. \\n\\nI promise promise promise you will get through this and will be feeling a lot better so soon. Just hang in there a few more days. You got this!!!! The results are so amazing, you WILL find a groove in the routine of it. And it will stop hurting and being such a thought and chore. Just takes a little time.It will be ok, really. I\\'m on tray 13/25 and I am very very used to them. It didn\\'t take long either. You will appreciate the difference it makes over time. I felt angry at first too. I had already gone through braces when I was a kid and didn\\'t want to go through a similar experience with Invisalign. But I\\'m very happy I am doing it. You will too. Hang in there!I felt the same. I\\'m neurotic. I told myself if I\\'m an adult and I hate it I can now choose to stop and waste my money but that was just to get rid of the anxiety. I\\'m a month in and it\\'s fine. Not a big dealI absolutely can relate!! I started Invisalign in September and the week after getting them I went on vacation to Sedona, and could not bring myself to smile properly because I was so embarrassed of what felt like a HUGE PIECE OF PLASTIC EVERYONE CAN SEE. But a couple weeks later I absolutely got used to them, and very soon I started noticing that my teeth actually look better and straighter in photos despite (or maybe thanks to) me wearing Invisalign. \\nNobody around me ever notices it, and I feel very confident weaeing it now that I\\'m halfway through my treatment and can see great results already! \\n\\nYou got this - this is an amazing investment in your health and confidence and you deserve to celebrate!!The first two days are awful. \\n\\nThe first two weeks still kinda suck. \\n\\nBy month two, its super smooth sailing.First 2-3 days are by FAR the worst. Many people feel this way. I bet by the end of the weekend youll be alright.I felt this way when I started too! Once you get used to it it\\'s much better. It\\'s honestly actually helped my mental health bc I\\'m so excited for nice teeth....and I know I HAVE to brush/floss more than I was before - it\\'s no longer \"optional\" depending on how I feel...which is strangely motivating \\x81\\n\\nEveryone on here is super nice and helpful too! So make sure you post questions or pics for encouragement if you want to \\x81The first two weeks were horrendous. If someone had of offered me morphine I would have taken it. I felt stupid for hurting myself so much, naÃ¯ve for thinking itd be fine, and totally regretted it. Then after about two weeks one night I got up to go to the loo, made it back to bed and only then remembered I was wearing them. Things started to get easier. The first two weeks I wanted nothing more than to rip them out of my mouth. Im now on week 12, I still dont find them comfortable, but no more than the feeling of wanting to take my bra off or a tight pair of jeans after a long day. Youll be fine, youve committed to the money now. Just sit it out for a few weeks and itll get easier.I felt the exact same way, but I promise it gets better! The first day I was like wtf did I just do and that feeling slowly subsided!Same here, I am on tray 15/96, only thing keeping continuing is to get the Final results and to get the perfect teethEverybody told me it gets better And it does. I had intense anxiety at the beginning every time I put the liners in my mouth. Is like claustrophobia. I am now eight weeks in and the anxiety has gone away. The discomfort Yep, theyre uncomfortable. And its intimidating to think about the path ahead. But Im in it.\\n\\nI trust it will get better for you and you get to choose. If it doesnt work for you and I dont do itThe past one year with Invisalign went by so fast for me. And now my teeth look amazingggg. I can\\'t claim to know exactly how you\\'re feeling and what else you have on your plate. But if you\\'re like me, getting a nice boost from accomplishing things, you\\'ll feel awesome a year from now.Its very overwhelming at first. Im almost 2 years in and while that is a long damn time, Im soooo used to it now.I felt the exact same way when I started last October, but I promise you these intense feelings will pass, and it absolutely will get better. Now I\\'m 12 trays in and get excited when it\\'s time to switch to a new tray. The pain will subside, you will figure out a routine, and soon, you won\\'t mind them. I do feel your pain at the moment though. It\\'s going to get better sooner than you think. Keep your head up! You got thisi was the same way: i had a mental breakdown as soon as i left the orthodontists office, and figured that i would be depressed and remorseful for the entire 14 month long treatment. fast forward to week two, and i feel the same way i did prior to getting them” i no longer feel pain when putting on my new aligners, and while i can no longer prolong my mealtimes to watch shows, its definitely not nearly as bad as it was the first few daysWhen I got my invisalign attachments last week (on many of my top and bottom teeth) my orthodontist must have sensed I was on the verge of a similar panic attack and patted my shoulder‚\\n\\nThey do suck at first, but just think how awesome your teeth will look in the end. And yes I was worried that they would make me look unattractive, but I decided that it really just doesn\\'t matter what other ppl think-just another way to see who\\'s real and who\\'s fake I guess.Humans are creatures of habit, you will get used to it. Not sure how much you disliked your teeth but I would say its worth it. Come back to this post in a few weeks after the adjustment period.Went through the same thing. Ill DM you, as I dont want to share everything here.One of the best decisions I\\'ve ever made when it comes to investing in me. The smile from ear to ear for the first few weeks after you finish your treatment is worth it on its own!I promise this will pass and youll be so thankful you did this for yourself.I had the same thing happen to me. I also had a jaw expander inserted, which honestly reminds me of an old torture device. Scared the living fuck out of me. \\n\\nI dealt with it and now I look back and Im so proud of myself for finding the strength to continue with it all. Nothing compares to having perfect straight teeth!!!Yeah when I talked to them dentists I felt like I was talking to a salesman leaving out details of the experience and just trying to get your money... Which they were. It\\'s not necessary but you\\'re already kind of committed now, ficially at least.Stick with it. I felt so similar. It all got better for me around week 3.I recently got Invisalign as well and I felt the same way! I hated it it the first couple days. One thing that helped me is just remembering that you are doing it to improve Yourself amd you will be very glad in the endYoure gonna have a great smile when youre done! Think of how thatll help your self esteem and mental health. You can do it!Nov 25 2019. Day 1. Last Tuesday one of my best friends was shocked to discover I was still in my Invisalign phase. Covid lengthened everything. My orthodontist is in another country but it made sense at the time as Im there 50% of the time. She was gobsmacked as shed completely forgotten. Its a way of life for me. Waiting for my first set of refinements. No regrets. I love it. Probably have another six months. Love being a part of that almost secret society. Close friends and associates really do forget. I carry a great sense of achievement as you will too. Hang on in there.Happens to eveybody, you get used to it and eventually will feel like nothingThe 1st and 2nd day it was terrible and I had this weird urge like I needed to eat/swallow them. It gets better!I did the same thing driving home with them for the first time.

I had to put down a deposit and then make monthly payments.  I\\'m thinking payment plans vary from clinic to clinicI paid upfront for a similar discount!Same. They were worried it would affect what I could get back on insurance, as there are annual limits for that. I confirmed with my insurance I could claim the big all in one payment for multiple years as long as I got a letter from the ortho saying I was still in treatment.\\n\\nIf you have the money to pay up front, the discount is worth it imo. But if it would make money tight, pick instalments.I paid a deposit and I\\'m paying it off monthly for four years. (One year down though!)I paid in full in order to get the discount as well. Figured no point in drawing it out if I didn\\'t have to.Same. Paid in full for a 5% discount. My only apprehension is if at the end for some unforseen reason I need to switch to traditional braces. I should have asked if they would charge me again.My contract says it will be an additional $800 if I because I want to change to traditional braces during treatment so maybe your contact will tell you.I\\'m going to go take a look. Says they stand by their Invisalign results. If I\\'m not happy with the end result they\\'ll do clear standard braces at no additional cost. Thanks for pointing out I have a contact. I know they went over the fees if I switched to braces mid way. I wish I had joined this sub sooner! It\\'s been very informative.i cant see why you\\'d need to go for braces after invisalign, worse come to worst you just get more refinements if you\\'re on invisalign comprehensive/full no?I am going to ask if what I paid for included refinements. I joined this sub after I paid in full. I didn\\'t know refinements were a thing. I just see people frustrated if a bite issue isn\\'t completely fixed and that\\'s why I am doing Invisalign, to fix my bite. I did ask them several times if I would be better off with traditional braces, and they told me I\\'d get the same end result, in the same amount of time regardless of which route I decided to take.I put ~10% down then monthly interest free for 18 months. Thatll push me into 2023 and I can pay the last 8 months off with my FSA.There was no discount offered for me so I just paid in parts when I had my check ups. My mum advised me not to pay upfront in case they get stingy with refinements etc but my dentist is lovely so I dont think it wouldve been an issue. However that may be something to think about.but with invisalign comprehensive where a treatment is usually an average of 12 months or so, the payment is completed within the first 6 months even if paying in parts so im not sure how refinements would be relevant hereI\\'m on comprehensive and my payment has a 12 month period.There was no restriction of 6 months to pay for me so Im not sure on that. In my part of the uk its normal to make sure you pay any remaining balance when your treatment is done. My treatment finished in 11 weeks and am now waiting for refinements. I still have some to pay and am withholding it till I am satisfied with my teeth. Idk what more to say. Refinements come with my plan and are free but like I said its just for peace of mind. Ive had no issues whatsoever.lucky you that your clinic allows to part payment at the end of the treatment , most clinics ive visited dont mention thatWhat a bummer sorry to hear that. Wish you the best for the course of your treatment :)Upfront and by bank transfer to get two discounts.i am now tempted to ask if i can get a further discount when paying by bank transfer on top of the payment in fullI received a good discount for paying upfront. I paid $1k out of pocket for 21 sets.lucky you, im paying Â4k for comprehensive which requires 26 alignersHow much is that in U.S.dollars? Forgive my ignorance4995 usdUpfront received a discountI made an initial down payment of about 25% and am paying the rest off in monthly installments. \\n\\nI know Im going to follow through on this until the end, but the smaller payments are easier on me ficially right now than a big lump sumThe argument against paying the full amount up front is that you can earn more than the 5% discount youre getting by investing that money. But with the way the stock market has been recently, you should just take the 5% discount lolIm in the UK and a 5% discount was never offered to meI paid full to get 5% discount. My thinking was the same as yours. Plus according to the plan I paid my dues and whatever may happen (including potentially finishing treatment with ceramic braces) I have already paid for.can you elaborate what you mean? i got lost when you mentioned finishing the treatment with braces.. i thought invisalign treatment was only clear aligners and no braces..I mean any \"deviation\" from the plan I have already paid for.\\n\\nAnd yes, it\\'s not something that\\'s very common, it\\'s called hybrid orthodontic treatment. I have a lot of crowding but didn\\'t have any extractions. Invisalign has its limits, but so do braces. While clear aligners are able to move one tooth at a time backwards, braces can\\'t really do that, but with braces they move according to the wire and sometimes they\\'re just better with complicated cases.\\n\\nRight now my plan is 67 top trays and 59 bottom trays on weekly changes. I was shown the simulation and by the end my teeth will still not be completely straight. Current plan is to finish off with ceramic braces, but my ortho has implied that he\\'ll see if we can avoid that so that I don\\'t have to bother with the adjustment period since I\\'m doing so well with aligners.\\n\\nIn any case, they have assured me that whatever happens (braces or extra aligners) is covered under what I have already paid for.If you have health insurance that can cover your Invisalign expenses but a max amount per calendar year, you can opt for paying it in parts. This would ensure you can claim it each year you have/pay for Invisalign and get the most money backPaid upfront for a 10% discount and in December so I could claim 20% of it back in a lump sum in my annual taxes (Ireland)!how is it possible to claim 20% of it back when doing the annual tax return? is that only allowed in ireland or UK too?i think it may only be in Ireland! but basically, certain dental procedures are eligible for a return and you submit a Med 2 form and get it back.

Please feel free to add in the comments!\\n\\n*Context:*\\nAges 11-13: braces on upper arch only, palate expander, and headgear. Successfully addressed crowding and partially addressed underbite; asked to come back when I finished growing.\\nAge 18: returned to ortho (after wisdom tooth extraction and lingual frenectomy) and deemed a surgical case to correct underbite. Declined surgical intervention because I wasnt in pain, though my bite was terrible (made contact on four teeth total, two molars per side).\\nAge 25: pursuing Invisalign treatment on both arches to correct a lateral and posterior open bite and correct spacing issues. Currently three months into treatment; I have 23 attachments (out of 28 teeth) with elastics.\\n\\n*Pros & Cons*\\n- Both require a serious commitment to oral hygiene; flossing is easier with Invisalign, but unlike braces, aligners need to be maintained (brushed/soaked). I dont like doing my oral care routine in public bathrooms during a pandemic, so I wouldve gone with regular braces if I didnt work from home.\\n\\n- Both are a ficial investment. My braces in adolescence were around $8k because my treatment was extensive (side note, braces are the only option for folks who need certain appliances), and my Invisalign was $5500 (would have been $5000 to go with regular braces, so the price differential is smaller than one might assume).\\n\\n- Treatment duration is comparable. Obviously everyone will vary, but I had braces for about two years, and I anticipate being in Invisalign treatment for a minimum of 18 months.\\n\\n- Ive actually found Invisalign far more painful than braces. I didnt experience pain when I had my braces tightened, but each new set of aligners hurts (nothing crazy, but I have a newfound appreciation for acetaminophen). Both options cut up the inside of my mouth.\\n\\n- I see my ortho every 6-8 weeks with Invisalign, vs. every two weeks or so with braces, and I occasionally required an emergency visit if a wire snapped (ouch)”Invisalign treatment isnt foolproof, but there are very few situations that would be considered œemergencies\\x9d with Invisalign. \\n\\n- I preferred eating with braces! I miss having hot drinks and food whenever I feel like it, and of course I have to maintain 22h wear time. On the flip side, though, I can eat anything I want as long as my trays are out (though I still dont eat corn on the cob”my teeth are too tender from Invisalign to bite into something hard like that, and it would get stuck in my attachments anyway).\\n\\n*TLDR*\\nBoth options are an investment in your long term health and well-being. Neither option is easy”at least, not as easy as having naked teeth :) And both are totally worth it to achieve a healthier bite and smile.I will ALWAYS choose invisalign, because I can't imagine having to pick through the attachments for braces after every meal, making sure they were clean. Plus, you don't have to make significant changes to your diets or avoid certain food with Invisalign.[deleted]Are you still undergoing Invisalign? They scanning was great for Invisalign, but they took normal impressions afterwards for the retainers.My take. I would of taking braces if I knew I couldnt drink with ease. Use to drink a lot of tea all day so that cut it out.  Thats my only complaint so far. \\n\\nBraves were cheaper and a month longer but Id be able to drink something other than waterMmmmm you can still drink tea. Im in refinements, 12 months of Invisalign so far and have been drinking tea, coffee, soft drink everyday with no issues.  As long as you rinse your mouth and give the trays a rinse, youll be fine.  \\nMy dentist and ortho havent noticed any issues with this either ·\\x8f»\\x8d‚ï¸\\x8f.The stain doesnt scare me but they said the heat could warp the trays.

Im so happy I move ahead with correcting the minor flaws in my smile!It definitely doesn't bother me much, I very rarely think aboutotice it. I have no confidence issues in my smile. I'm just wondering if it'll just get worse and worse so I should treat it early, or if it's ok to leaveI had bottom crowding and it definitely got worse with age, but I also started Invisalign at 42, so theres no rush.I reckon I had some similar crowding on the bottom and its taken me 22 weeks to fix it. My treatment isnt over because Im also fixing an overbite, but it could be a quick few months for you. So if it bothers you and youre willing to spend the money, Id fix it.But it's more than just the money+few months, it's also then wearing a retainer for life, right? That's the part that bothers me the mostYoure right, that is an important factor. After months of 20“22 hours of daily wear though, you really get accustomed to wearing aligners. \\n\\nIt did concern me to commit to the lifetime retainer wear before I started but at this point I can honestly say it wont be a bother. The aligners dont impact my sleep at all.\\n\\nStill, its something youll have to be diligent about and decide if you can commit to it before you startI had roughly that same crowding on the bottom, but my top front teeth were also tilted 45 degrees inwards and I had a misaligned bite. Would I have done it for the bottom only? No, but that's me. I'm not completely done yet, but was it worth it? Absolutely yes.\\n\\nHere are the questions I asked myself when making the decision: Do you feel uncomfortable showing teeth when you smile? Do you feel the need to improve your appearance? Can you afford to spend up to $5,000 over time on it? Do you the willpower to endure the rules and restrictions for over a year? Will you be able to wear a retainer at night for the rest of your life?I had a similar level of overcrowding and I went for the consultation because it had started causing chips on my upper incisors. Learned I had an overbite and fixing that is very likely to fix my bruxism, so it was a win win. I'd say definitely go for a consultation with an orthodontist. They can tell you a lot and there isn't any obligation.It can fix night grinding? That's the first I hear of that - if that's true then it's definitely a HUGE plus. I'll go consult and see, thanks.Definitely! It's not something that's true in every case, of course. The orthodontist/dentist should be able to  tell you if they think that's going to be something that applies for you.\\n\\n*Edited to add: I do have to wear rubber bands on my aligners as part of fixing that jaw misalignment. They're not bad at all, and actually make my jaw feel so much more comfortable than before treatment, but it removes a chunk of the Invisible from the Invisalign, lol.My night grinding is gone. I also used to clench and no longer do that.I thought night grinding was suppoesd to be 100% caused by stress, nothing to do with structure of the jaw/teeth!Im not sure, maybe its just the trays being in my mouth and acting as a night guard or something.Ohhhh yes, they replace night guards. I thought you meant that after finishing with invisalign, even without wearing anything to bee you stopped grinding. False hope :(I have something similar and they told me a tooth was getting flushed up and was going to get chipped away by the top teeth. Also that they would keep moving and I could eventually lose it. Its my front bottom teeth though.I have overcrowding and the bottom and I was getting low grade gum infections.

Luckily when i got to my 20s the one comment i still remember to this day is œYour teeth look great\\x9d, this was told to me by a person who i used to work with and saw how crooked my smile used to be.

Other peoples behavior is never about us. Typically a reflection of how they feel about themselves.This ! When I see people trying to insult me about my outlook, before I was thinking they are right. Now I pity them. Because their defense mechanism is about attacking other peoples insecurities. It was never about my crooked smile or outlook. It was their mind being small and thats all.\\n\\nLove your differences, it will add to the charisma.I am on tray 12 of 24,  and I notice the change and feel different.  At the risk of sounding conceded, I do think that having crooked and dirty teeth does give a bad stereotype on a person.  We see before and after photos on this subreddit,  and the after photos not only make the mouth like healthier and more attractive,  it gives the person a different appeal altogether. More beautiful/handsome,  distinguished, even things unrelated like more intelligent.\\n\\nYes,  it\\'s an ugly truth,  but getting your teeth straightened does uplift your facial profile which can get you farther socially.I hope this doesnt offend anyone but I have a noticeably large gap in my front teeth and I think some honestly think Im less intelligent at first because of it. Sucks but is what it is I guessSure, gaps might have that effect for some people, but not all, since some people find gaps cute. (I had a massive gap in my front two teeth when I was little). Either way, if you feel thats how a gap makes you feel about yourself, you can either choose to try to work through that mentality or just be happy that Invisalign can close the gap for you!\\n\\nI have a super smart friend with a gap in his teeth and I dont think the gap makes him look less intelligent, but I certainly think that he would look better if his teeth were straightened. Of course, thats just my aesthetic opinion and I have never mentioned his teeth to him, and if he never fixed them I wouldnt think anything less of him.If it helps theres a bunch of models with gaps in their teeth. Seen as a bit of an attractive quirk. Though I guess if you look like a model easier to get away with these things\\n\\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/gap-toothed-models_n_4038443In some cultures, having a gap is seen as a sign of beauty and intelligence.For me crooked teeth means you just didnt have the $$$ to get it fixed earlier. So basically you had shit parent, shit childhood and shit hygiene.\\n   \\nAt least thats how I see myself. I keep thinking œif only my family didnt suck so much and sent me get them fixed when I was a teen\\x9d or œI didnt have the money to afford treatment before\\x9d.\\n   \\nBut thats just me and my super skewed, angry and honestly bitter perspective.\\n   \\nFor anyone whos had a more healthy upbringing, I think they dont give a fuck as long as it looks œok\\x9d.You might be surprised by this, but 50% of the patients at my orthos are adults, and 50% of those adults had braces as kids. Up until just recently I guess, orthos told kids to throw away their retainers after wearing them a year after braces. ’ Today, I never just go by what a professional tells me, but I hadnt yet learned that lesson back then \\n\\nMy brother, sister and I all had perfectly straight teeth after braces back in the late 90s”currently, we all have crooked teeth. Mine arent too bad, but I have crowding in my bottom teeth. My dad (who BTW also had braces in the 50s/60s), had really crowded bottom teeth and ended up with bone loss in his 70s and lost those teeth. Thats what motivated me to move forward with this. \\n\\nIm sorry you didnt have the upbringing you wanted. :( I read once that I think its about 98% of all families that are dysfunctional in some way. I believe this. Get to know any family, and no matter how ideal they seem on the outside, youll find problems. All we can do is the best with what weve been given and be thankful for the good things, right? ºï¸\\x8f I wish you the best!Thanks man. I mean, I know I view things in life though a cynical and bitter lens. \\n   \\nWhen I look at my teeth, which are now undergoing treatment, I keep thinking œall these wasted years, all these sleepless nights, all the shame and sadness\\x9d. And I fault in part my family, their lifestyle choices and the little care they had for my health.\\n   \\nBut ultimately I also did not chose to get this solved earlier, because of ficial or other reasons throughout my life. \\n   \\nSo now that I can finally afford to spend the money on me, I am left with the resentment against my family.\\n   \\nAs you said, I am thankful and even though the process is slow, I am very happy to be where I am now, with that kind of technology and keep thinking the me in a year will be so glad of the actions taken by the me of nowSo sorry youve been through all that. :( Wouldnt it be so great if you could find a way to let go of that resentment by the time youre done with Invisalign, so at the end, youll really be a new you? Your emotions arent wrong, and we cant help what we feel, but we can change the emotions we feed and also our outlook. That resentment is just as unhealthy for you as the crooked teeth. ” Ive seen bitterness *destroy* two people I used to know who were very exceptional people in many ways. It basically made these highly intelligent men go crazy in the end. \\n\\nI guess I could be angry towards my old ortho.  I figure it is what it is, and we cant go back and change things. He probably gave the advice he had been taught. My health was also badly damaged (and I still struggle) by an antibiotic”my doctor gave me an antibiotic that I was too young for. The thing is, nearly all of us get some bad breaks in life. I grew up privileged and with loving parents, but Ive had some bad breaks thrown my way too”I dont think anyone is immune from that. I just keep going, refuse to give up, and refuse to let past hurts and damage take away my joy. Bitterness will take away your joy, friend. \\n\\nIf your family was ficially limited, they probably werent able to provide all that was needed. If they were emotionally limited, they may have grown up under hard circumstances. Im not excusing whatever they may have done, but if you can start looking for little things in which you can find some compassion for them, that would be a great start. \\n\\nFor me, Im also a believer in Christ, and that gives me a huge advantage, because God fills us with His Holy Spirit when we choose to follow Him, and that makes it much easier to love and forgive others. \\n\\nPerhaps you could look for some online help with your issues or counseling? Im rooting for you to be able to shake this off and truly be œfree.\\x9d Sending a big hug! —Youre a good man. Thanks for taking the time to write this, brother.\\n   \\nI am walking the path of forgiveness and try each day to be a little better, kinder and tolerant. Im way out there but looking back, I am glad. In a year I hope to be better still and look onward with a better mindset.Aww, I love this, and youre so, so welcome!! With that attitude, youre going to be okay!! The two men I knew refused to forgive or try to let go of their anger, and thats what destroyed them. \\n\\nYoure going to be a whole new person soon. Im really excited for what awaits you, and you know what? I bet youll end up helping a lot of people get through similar struggles. \\n\\nI pray Gods richest blessings and healing over you! The best times are ahead of you! ŠSo I had severely jacked up teeth. I\\'ve posted here a few times, I\\'m the girl with the two rows of teeth lol\\n\\nYes people treat me differently now that my teeth are almost straight. No question about it. When I converse with people now they don\\'t look at me, then look at my mouth, then at me, then back at my mouth. \\n\\nThey look at me. No one looks at my teeth anymore. The few times I\\'ve told people I had braces only one had ever noticed I had attachments on my teeth. \\n\\nPeople are nicer in general. \\n\\nWhen I started wearing masks I noticed how much nicer people treated me. It\\'s true of my teeth being straight too. \\n\\nIt is what it is.Theres a meme I remember seeing. It showed a guy with a missing tooth and a caption saying something like œSee how important dental care is? You didnt even notice he has one shoe on.\\x9d\\n\\nLol its a great ad for their company but its the truth. You could seriously be wearing rags. Like your dirtiest clothes, gym stained, yard work torn shit, but if you have a perfect smile it erases all of that. I wish I knew this growing up because it took 28 years to actually find out, but god damn doing this Invisalign is BY FAR the best thing Ive ever done for myselfTeeth is the first thing that people notice about you. As others have said, it comes down to layers and layers of human psychology that is reflected from our teeth. I had braces as a kid, fixed my gaps and then after a year I lost the retainer and slowly but surely my teeth moved back and created the gap again. Although the gap was not terribly big like how it was when I was a kid, it did cause me serious confidence + image issues. \\n\\nI was always taking pictures with my mouth shut like 99.9% times. When in conversation, I couldn\\'t help but notice when people look at your teeth first and sometimes I would be extremely insecure to talk to people, and when I did talk, I\\'d say something stupid out of anxiety. I was often angry about my teeth and how I fucked up my early 20\\'s by not taking care of my grills. Luckily, I started to make some serious dough in the last few years and decided enough, and took the chance with Invisalign, AND BOY I COULD NOT EXPRESS HOW HAPPY I AM! \\n\\nSERIOUSLY! My inner/outer confidence has strengthened by a thousand. I regularly use teeth whiteners and my teeth have never been this beautiful and white, and they seriously are starting to look better than most people, so in a way the tables have turned in my favor. even though my treatment has only started a few months ago, the difference is actually LIFE changing. I am able to be so much more confident, and my true confident self is finally coming to the surface. This is really anecdotal but there was this one girl I had my eye on for years, and she would NEVER attempt to start a conversation or get to know me, and last weekend she came up to me and we had the most incredible conversation which led to her planning a \"date\" with me. Yeah I couldn\\'t believe that either.  I could tell she was glancing at my new grills a lot during our convo. Yep.. life changingPublic speaker here. Yup, its was fascinating to me how much treatment of me changed after my teeth were straight. \\n\\nBut after thinking about it, when people meet you they make preconceived notions on looks alone. Teeth are a part of it. Think of it this way, if you meet someone and their shirt is all wrinkled up, what do you think?  What would your differing thought be if it was nicely ironed?  \\n\\nTeeth are kinda like that.I dont think anybody treated me differently when I had crooked teeth vs straightened teeth. I recall maybe a handful of comments & suggestions about my crooked teeth. One big thing though was my confidence. It seriously skyrocketed after being more comfortable with my smile. With a boost of confidence, people wanted to hang around longer & chat some more.Thats something Im really looking forward to. Ill finally want to smile with my teeth for pictures. Its crazy how much an impact our smile can make on usI like to think its because I am smiling more and not hiding it :)I think it\\'s partially a mindset change for me? I feel like I\\'m treated slightly differently, feels weird to say but I seem to be getting slightly more attention and like, appreciative looks and advances. But having straighter teeth has made me more confident- i smile more and im more expressive bc im not trying to hide a part of my face, so that will make people treat you differently[deleted]Either. I suppose. Although I cant think of a situation where someone would be treated negatively for fixing their teethI feel that the difference in how people treat you should develope because you feel more comfortable and your part of interactions get better because of that. If people would now only be nice to you because change in teeth, I would rather not interact closely with them. But this could be possible ofcourse and it is hard to figure out; did they change or did I change?\\n\\nSo I dont think the people who treat you differently (initiating from their side not because of you being more comforable and less self conscious) should be the people you surround yourself with. They should be around you because they like who you are and what you think for the biggest part instead of your teeth/other looks. Of course looks is still a very important part of that but it should not be the reason how you treat somebody imo. \\n\\nBut thinking about this, an invisalign trajectery does often also improve hygiene and how you take care of your body. I do see a lot of examples of this sub of people with already top notch hygiene, so there would be no change in those cases. \\n\\nImproving hygiene is something everybody could do, and that would improve your interactions and how people treat you a lot too (apart from just straighter teeth). I think that is a very legit reason to change how you \\'treat\\' someone. So if that\\'s the case and others treat you better now, that could be true and should be fine!This is a really interesting take. I agree that the amount of respect and kindness you show someone should be based on whats on the inside but I do acknowledge that someone might be less attracted to me physically dating wise because of my teeth and I dont really blame them for that. You cant help what youre attracted to. I think my hygiene has always been pretty solid lolThanks! With good hygiene and taking care of the rest teeth wise now, you will be fine and change your side of your interactions!\\n\\nI have the same experience but some girls didn\\'t care about at all, even though looking perfect looks and teethwise themselves. \\n\\nOnly the ones that were focused on it cared about it and I didn\\'t even bother dating them. Because i did not like their focus in life and it didn\\'t line up with mine at all. That means I would not date them after invisalign either.I only had really mild problems with mine (my lateral incisors were slightly tilted and my front teeth were a bit flat instead of that nice curved arch) so no one came at me for mine. I get around the same amount of people say they like my teeth \\n\\nMy best friend though omg his teeth were like overlapped at the front and the difference when he had his braces off :) I was like a proud mum honestlyAww thats so sweet. As of right now my dentist is recommending that once Im done with Invisalign I should get veneers on the two teeth that sit right beside my front teeth if I want that œperfect smile\\x9d. Im honestly so excited and think it will be a bit emotional when my teeth are all done. I feel a little nervous too though because even though its a change I want, its still a changeVeneers are a commitment and a half lol \\n\\nTheyre nowhere near as bad as crowns, but unless hes going to do no prep veneers, some of your natural tooth will be shaven off so its going to need a veneer on always and thats expensive. \\n\\nIf its just length then please consider bonding, I have that on those teeth as well and its lasted around 8 years now with no problems, and if it chips off then I still have all my natural tooth left :)) \\n\\nBut do whatever you feel comfortable with and Im so happy for you!! \\x9dï¸\\x8fThank you :)\\nThose teeth didnt form right for me and as result are exceptionally smaller than the rest of my teeth. Ill have to go over all the options with my dentist!*Same* \\n\\nMine are like super short in comparison to all my others. They could barely latch onto them even with an attachment on both sides of both teeth :) but bonding worked wonders for me and its no big deal if it comes off because Ive still got all my toothI feel like I cant look people in the eye because of my teeth. I actually was soooo much more confident when wearing a mask. I love my eyes but I feel like my teeth detract from my face and featuresIm sorry I used to feel this way when my acne was a lot worse. Other people dont fixate on the things we ruminate onNot really, it just allowed me to express myself better. Same thing happened for me with my acne struggles.What helped you clear your skin?Honestly, I got sick of fighting my poor genetics and the whole trial and error process with researching and trying out skincare. \\n\\nAs soon as I could afford it, I sought a dermatologist\\'s help and it\\'s been working great ever since! I struggled with acne from the time I was 14 up until I was 20. It cleared up on its own overtime but there were still a couple of blemishes and pustules that popped up every now and then. Dermatologist is the way to go in my opinion!Unfortunately I have been to  a dermatologist and it wasnt very helpful. I dont have insurance so the visit was 160 out of pocket and then she spent barely 5 minutes with me. Maybe Ill try a different one, its just hard not knowing if itll be worth the moneyAh I see, I guess dermatologists don\\'t necessarily work for all. End of the day it\\'s also important to remember that acne skin is normal skin. Most people don\\'t really care about a couple of blemishes on your face.Yeah I get that. I started getting acne early around age 8 and Im about to be 21 now. I just sometimes feel like its never gonna go away and Ill never have clear skin againI also recently had posted on Reddit for advice about rhinoplastys and ended up with a lot of comments telling me take care of my skin instead and idk I think it mightve triggered me a little bit. I hadnt felt sad about my skin for quite awhile before thatHaha, the journey was rough for me as well. I\\'ve given up several times. What\\'s really effective is probably oral medication in my opinion, however you can\\'t take it for too long otherwise it loses its efficacy. \\n\\nI took some pills which I assume was isotretinoin, worked wonders but I couldn\\'t take it for longer than 6 months according to my dermatologistOh accutane? Did you experience any side effects ?The brand itself wasn\\'t Accutane, but yes the pill should be similar. There are different dosages and all.\\n\\nSides effects were just a little dryness on the lip and certain areas of the face.My partner said to me that when I have straight teeth Ill be perfect ‚, that scored him some brownie points „ he never ever commented on my teeth before I said I was getting Invisalign. I now, even with the aligners in, feel Im not stifling a big smile anymore or sort of hiding my mouth. I never realised I did this until I stopped. How we feel about ourselves makes us more appealing to other people.I had Invisalign when it was new back in middle school and never wore the trays properly and abandoned my treatment before I was finished. My front teeth still overlap.\\n\\nMy teeth arent something Im conscious about in my day to day interactions and Ive never had people comment or seem put off by my mouth. I think I have other, better, features that distract from my teeth.\\n\\nWith that being said, I wish I had finished my treatment and consider taking another crack at it. Ive always wanted straight teeth.\"Your teeth are fucked\" - My ex. So people definitely noticed for me.For me, no one has noticed that my teeth are straight lol.I can\\'t speak on this 100%, as I\\'m only on tray 6 of my treatment and my teeth are still pretty \"sharky\" lol BUT I can speak for people\\'s behavior change when undergoing big visible changes. I had a breast augmentation many years ago, and I saw a DRASTIC change in how people viewed me, and interacted with me. On the flip side, my confidence went through the roof because I felt more comfortable in my skin, which I anticipate happening again once my smile is more straight. \\nMost of us subconsciously want to interact with people we perceive as attractive, which includes a smile for many of us.  We don\\'t all do it on purpose, but it\\'s something that is even taught in sales - there have been quite a few studies done on itI dont think people that knew me treat me different. But I smile at strangers a lot more so I know I treat others different.I dont have Invisalign (had braces as a kid) but I can speak from the viewers perspective”I absolutely notice myself responding better to people with really nice teeth, and responding less to people with really bad teeth. Especially noticed this when dating”you could be the hottest guy Ive ever seen, but if you have really bad teeth I wont even bother. (This includes color”people dont need to have veneer-white teeth, but noticeably yellow teeth to me are kinda ick.

Thats often reported here. Some orthos try to take the easy way out by talking about the bite having to settleœ, but I think thats nonsense. The bite should be perfect when the treatment is finished. Like others have commented, I would insist on the ortho finishing the job and ask for refinements.Think of it this way, you have a pair of a few mm thermoplastic aligner creating space between your teeth. Naturally, youre going to have a temporary posterior open bite which in my humble experience tends to settle once that interference is removed.I see your point, and I understand where those open bites are coming from. \\n\\nNevertheless, I think the bite should be perfect upon completion. I had braces before and got them removed with a slight posterior open bite and was reassured dont worry, let it just settle a bitœ. Well, that settlingœ meant lapsing back to a certain degree into the deep bite and overjet that braces were supposed to fix in the first place, and with the retainers not fitting well anymore soon. (I mean, how are you supposed to achieve solid retention when the bite is supposed to settleœ during daytime but moved back by the retainer every night to how the bite was at the end of treatment?)\\n\\nEveryones case is different, but I for one will not accept the let it just settleœ reassurance again.This happened to me on my last tray, only on the right side tho. My ortho noticed and cut the back of my upper aligner on the back and the molars were able to touch. Thats the most likely solution theyll provide.But if you think about it, theres the height difference from the plastic on ALL the teeth, so if you take the trays out the bite should line up. If theres an open bite then its because the molars arent lined up properly or theres a height difference between the front and back teeth. Id suspect that if its minor enough that you can only feel it when you bite down then theyd shift over time, but if you can actually see it as a bit of an open bite then adjustments should be madeAfter 2.5 years of Invisalign and them opening up my posterior bite and causing more issues than i had at the start, I ended up in braces 2 weeks ago. Ill never recommend Invisalign to anyone ever  unless its to close a gap or something VERY minorThis! Traditional braces for bite issues are the way to goDude same exact thing happened to me! Had a crossbite, did Invisalign for 2 years, caused an open posterior bite that I didn't have originally. Had to get metal braces. Open bite closed more in 1 month of metal braces than almost 1 year on Invisalign. If I had to do it all over, I would have done metal braces from the jump.

Im just scared it will cost way more than they say without getting the result I want..i am liking my results so far, my teeth werent bad to begin with, i just wanted to fix my overbite and get them straightened out a bit. im only on week five so i havent gotten refinements yet. refinements just take into account any sort of variability, such as teeth not moving the way the computer depicts, tweaking the outcome, etc.I just finished invisalign. 19 months, Â3.7k (with fixed retainer added) and it was absolutely 100% worth the time and money. I had a ton of elastics too.I did normal braces and am glad I did braces tbh they were faster than Invisalign for me[deleted]Is it standard that refinements dont cost extra?

You have masks on anyway nobody gon see it as wellI had braces before. Not doing that again, so I went with invisalign and I'm happy about it. Invisalign is less visible than braces, which is important to me. The ortho also said that both will take equal amount of time. If braces took 50% less time or so, maybe I would consider it, but since the time difference wasn't there, I went with invisalign.

The middle two are shifted backwards so my left tooth (right in this photo?

I didnt have bite issues before treatment and I had really straight teeth when I was younger after braces but unfortunately didnt wear my retainer. I told the ortho that I was open to braces or Invisalign, whichever one would give me the best results.Ohhhhh ok I understand what youre getting at now. I had the same issue as you - then I has another set of refinements and it was corrected by that. How long was your plan for?I was in Invisalign for nearly a year. I think I initially had a set of 14 aligners and I had maybe 3-5 sets of refinements. He wanted to take them off and I told him about the issue and he ordered another set of refinements. I shouldve asked for another set instead of getting them taken off, but his office was so unorganized and I kind of felt like he was being insensitive, so I decided to just get them taken off and accept them how they were. Also I was under the impression that it was normal for my bite to feel off until they settled so I was like eh maybe theyll be fine after a few weeks of getting them taken off.Awwwww Im so sorry!

Dont listen to anyone who says otherwise, its about what you want.If you did youd get bonding on the teeth either side to even out the length.I personally really do love the character of a gap, but if its something that makes someone feel self conscious then change it up.they will probably also pull down and angle the teeth beside your front teeth so everything will look balanced. I had teeth that had not descended fully and Invisalign worked really well for that!Those are platitudes. If I say \"should I wear make-up?\" Everyone will say \"no you are beautiful how you are!\" people are being polite. \\n\\nThe real answer is yes, close that gap and straighten those lower teeth. \\nThe crooked bottom teeth usually leads to other issues like plaque build up or difficulties flossing, or easily chipped teeth. A gap is usually considered cute on little children, some young women who are models with youthful features. On most people, a gap will make people treat you like a child, and will increase tooth chipping risk.Do it. I had the same gap. People said I looked like Michael Strahan and forest Whitaker. I said cool, but I don\\'t have Strahan/Whitaker money. Those same people who told me to keep it do not echo those sentiments now.I think you can get a mock-up done in the consultation of how youre teeth will look after adjustments. Its usually a 3D model of your teeth from dozens of picturesDo it. If you wouldve done it right at your consultation, youd be done by now or at latest half way to the finish line. Good luck!I think it looks good, but its actually some of your other teeth Im worried about.  You could talk to them about a plan that doesnt close the gap all the way but fixes some of the other crowding.If I had your teeth, I would close it and straighten my lower teeth as wellThank you for your opinion!Go get the clincheck. It will give you a better idea of the end result.Its hard to tell without seeing all of you. Sometimes that gap is part of a person and looks good on them. The little quirks that make a person individual.I am pretty new to Reddit so Im not sure how to add a picture to this post or anything lol. Otherwise I would show you the whole face/smile combo for better perspective.I have no idea how to either „Most people use imgur and link to the image.\\n\\nFor what it\\'s worth from looking at your comments I say go for it! Sounds like you want to and you\\'re just looking for permissionYou can post a photo to your profileI had a large gap, friends said they liked it and I heard from my girl-friends that it was œcute.\\x9d  I personally hated it, and always wanted it closed, thinking veneers were my only option.  Needless to say I am extremely happy with my teeth now after Invisalign.  You gotta do what makes YOU happy.I had a front tooth gap. Am now on tray 15/24. Looking back at photos from 6 months ago I can\\'t believe the difference it\\'s made. 100% worth itThanks for sharing your experience! I am glad you are having the results you want!Your gap looks similar to mine btw, you may need to get a \"maxillary midline frenectomy\" which will prevent that gum tissue between your front teeth from coming back and ruining the results. My ortho has referred me off to a periodontist to have that done at the end of my treatment.Edit: I just saw your reply to a comment below about not smiling. I think if thats the case you should get rid of the gap. I did Invisalign because I had a tooth that stuck way out and I have not smiled with my teeth since it came in that crooked. No matter how much people say they think its cute or like it you probably wont feel the same. I am officially smiling with my teeth more often now even though the tooth is still a little crooked. The first picture I saw with my teeth made me cry because I didnt feel awful or embarrassed about it. I totally understand your pain so do what will make you feel good about yourself!!! Good luck \\x9dï¸\\x8f\\n\\nPersonally I love a gap! My husband has one (a little less than yours) and its my favorite thing. Now if you dont like the gap then by all means get rid of it. On the other hand maybe you could talk to your dentist/ortho about only slightly narrowing the gap? If you like the way that looks maybe you could do refinements at the end to close it more if you werent happy with it still. My friend had her gap only slightly closed and shes really happy she didnt go all the way. In the end I think its up to you. However if someone says they like the gap believe them because its true ºï¸\\x8fI really appreciate your perspective on both sides of this. I do believe some people genuinely like gaps. I personally think some people look good with them. I could be over critical of myself, but I dont feel its a very attractive quality on me. I kind of recently got thrown back into the dating pool so I think Im looking more closely at myself and seeing what œflaws\\x9d I can work on to make myself more attractive and receive some positive attention from women lol. There is not a ton I can do to improve my overall appearance I feel, but this is something I might have control over.I personally would but youve got to do what makes YOU feel good.I appreciate your honest opinion! Thank youI have a small gap and Id personally close it if money werent an issue. If it will make you more confident, do it.I like to think it would make me more confident and hopefully get me some more positive attention from women.I can totally understand that!Ultimately its your choice and your choice only. \\nPersonally, I adore gaps. They add a unique quality to a person and Im sad when I see them closed. However, if you dont like your smile and its not practical for you, then get Invisalign.I basically never smile with my teeth showing because I am self conscious of my teeth, mainly the gap. I do think they look good on some people, Im just not sure its the most attractive on me.Sounds like you want Invisalign than.That\\'s your answer right there. You are not smiling with your teeth because you don\\'t like your smile. I had a big gap but had it reduced and not completely closed.Do it then. A lifetime of being self conscious about your smile is the answer to your question. I dont think youll regret it!Why are you on the fence?I got mine because of crowding on the bottom, similar to yours but a little worse. When it comes to the gap up top, I think it\\'s pretty fun.\\n\\nMaybe have someone Photoshop you without it, see what you think?Its too bad they havent figured out how to show you what youd look like with your new smile, like as part of the consult. I mean obviously it wouldnt be 100% accurate but it seems like the technology is there to get somewhat of an idea!There is \\'Smileview\\' on the Invisalign website. I expect it just kicks out fairly generic results but should give an idea... https://www.invisalign.com/get-started/invisalign-smileview?v=0#startI would personally but its up to you and how much it really bothers you.I was on the fence and so glad I finally started. I have front tooth gap as well. Im already on week 5 and its been a minor inconvenience at most. The horror stories I read in here made it seem like it was going to be way worse than it has!\\n\\nI have 30 trays. The way I see it, in 30 Weeks, I will either have the teeth I want, or I wont. Its that simple.\\n\\nYou should do it - Im already noticing my gal getting smaller and its only week 5!The horror stories I have read on here since joining this community recently have made me hesitate a little more about it lol. Its good to hear your experience has gone well, I am happy for you! Definitely gives me encouragement to think about moving forward.Just do it man youll\\nBe happy you did. Its pretty easy tbhWhat do YOU want? Other peoples opinions doesnt really matter, they will always going to be nice about it if you ask them :) I chose to close mine because I am insecure about it. Do whatever makes you feel the most confident and happy :)I am pretty self conscious about mine too so I think the choice is clear, I still feel hesitant though.I had a gap, got bonding for the gap in my front teeth ten years ago. (Got invisalign in 2021.) Getting the gap fixed was the single most dramatic change I have ever made to my appearance. I was able to date higher echelon guys, married one of them, doors opened more easily in my career. Getting my gap fixed altered the course of my life.Invisalign and lasik were the two best things I\\'ve ever done for myself. Invisalign is much easier than people often make it seem on this sub.\\n\\nI recommend getting Invisalign. I didn\\'t realize how much my teeth needed to be improved or how much I thought about it until I was a few months into Invisalign and really started to see the progress. It is expensive though and is also a commitment-- so make sure you\\'re ready for those aspects before diving in.\\n\\nNo harm in getting another consult. Just make sure to go to a respected orthodontist and never just a dentist. \\n\\nBest of luck with whatever you decide.>Invisalign is much easier than people often make it seem on this sub.\\n\\nInvisalign is fine because I was at home for the last 1.5-2 years. If I wasn\\'t at home it would be a big inconvenience, if you carry a purse around its better but you still have to duck out to a restroom or car to take them off before eating/drinking.  \\n\\n\\nIMO braces are easier to live with than invisalign but theyre very visible. Pros and cons to each.To each their own. I had braces (top front teeth were ceramic, back and lowers were metal) in my early 20\\'s and I have Invisalign now in my mid-30\\'s. I would never do normal braces again after experiencing Invisalign. \\n\\nWhen I had normal braces, I still had to brush after every meal. Otherwise, you risk staining. Also, when I had rubber bands with braces, I had to take those out before eating. It takes 2 seconds to pop out my aligners with Invisalign -- about the same effort as removing those rubber bands I had with braces. \\n\\nTo me, the benefits of Invisalign greatly outweigh braces.You are so correct, I wished I had started when everyone was WFH! Everything would have been less stressful, as no one was going to dinner, coffee, bars, etc. Unfortunately, with the anchors on my teeth, I have a hard time getting them off, on week 3. However, as someone said before, at week 3 you kinda start accepting the foreign object in your mouth lol!Do it if you got the money.I think that you will not regret your decision once youve done it,  time flies by pretty fast,  the only thing is it you can afford it ficially or not and if you are ready to put up with some inconveniences (pain, remove trays when you eat, etc)Youll need a frenectomy first to get rid of the extra skin in between the gap then Invisalign! I had it done no pain but I hated my gap so much more confident without it but its your choice !!I think when I had my consultation a year ago they mentioned the frenectomy. They said its quick thing to fix.I had bonding on my two front teeth 10 years before I had invisalign and they never clipped mine.I think that peoples teeth look best when theyre a bit œindividual\\x9d, so you still look like you. I like the gap. \\n\\nIm fixing all my bottom teeth that are jammed together so close I couldnt even floss, but leaving the longer length on the top front two so theyll still look a bit œimperfect\\x9dShould close it and straighten your teeth. Look like a completely different personIve got a similar gap, I got a consultation and instead going with standard metal braces and having a small procedure to remove gum between the gap so they fully close, you also look like youd need the same procedure to fully close up, but actually doing it is up to you, Ive been self conscious about my gap all my life, if youre the same thats youre answer. If you do want to get rid of it, start now and thank yourself later if you started a year ago when you had first consultation it would probably be near enough closed nowI definitely have been self conscious about it for a long time. I guess that alone should make the decision easier, but its still not an easy decision for me for some reason.If it bothers you, then go for it! Its an investment in yourself. Cant go wrong with that. Personally my bottom teeth were terrible & it gave me self confidence issues. Especially when I heard some of my friends talking about another coworker that said hes cute but his bottom teeth are jacked. Mine were way worse than that. I wonder if my friends were saying the same thing about my teeth. I didnt think my top teeth were too bad until they were straight. It changed my whole face in a good wayI\\'m a 41M who started Invisalign because I am still dating. I feel self conscious about my smile. I\\'ve been on it for 4 months and although I\\'m only on tray 10/26,  I feel really good about the change I have seen and that I am dong something about my smile instead of living with what I don\\'t like.\\n\\nThe quote is $5,000 and every three months I visit the orthodontist it is $141. it is not covered by my dental insurance. For me,  it was worth it.  I have had LASIK and enjoy that I do not need glasses anymore unless reading and programming. Both the Invisalign and LASIK are cosmetic for me. I\\'ve embraced the idea that I need a little help in looking my best.\\n\\nBetween us guys (and everyone on Reddit),  I have teeth like yours minus the front gap.  The neater your teeth are,  the more refined you look.  It \"gentrifies\" and \"cleans up\" your appeal and presentation. Unfortunately prettier and handsome people are received better. If others have commented or stared at your teeth,  you should get it.\\n\\n**If you decide to do it,  specifically go to an orthodontist.**  Don\\'t go for the cheap specialists,  as they are not trained for all situations,  and I am not sure why they are allowed to offer Invisalign.I appreciate your input! Honestly one of the bigger reasons I am considering this is because I am hoping it will help attract more female attention. I know that may not seem like a great reason to some people but its the truth at least lol.It is a great reason.  Lets be realistic,  looks count.  Get the Invisalign,  it\\'s a great cosmetic boost.\\n\\nWish I had the money when I was in my 20s.I say yesAs someone who got Invisalign based on a comment from someone else, please dont care what anyone else says in doing it! Mine was just one tooth that I didnt like, and they so happened to point it out. I dont regret it at all, but wish I spent more time understanding how much time it would take etc. and that I made the decision more so for myself. I think its totally preference, some people will think the gap is unique and really love it, others will think the opposite. End of the day all you can do is decide what you think would make you feel better! Every other person told me I didnt need it for the record. \\nIf you got a consult did they show you what your scan would look like after treatment? This might be helpful to see if youd like to know what it might look like! \\n\\nSorry for the ramble! All the best either way!Honestly nobody I personally know has given me a negative comment about the gap, but I dont think any of them would either way. I think they probably know Im a bit self conscious about it and wont say anything too blunt thinking they might offend me. Its just hard to know for sure what the people in your everyday life really think when it comes to something like this because you know they dont want to upset you. I can understand making the decision after someone comments on it directly like they did yours, but Im happy you dont regret getting Invisalign after that. Thanks for sharing your experience.so the choice is yours! and all the best!   \\ns feeling very conscious about my smile and over the years I could see the gap widening. I always felt that it was a huge cost and just the process would be cumbersome, But as the pandemic hit, it made it easier to go through the process and I was able to save up some money on Commute. There is a permanent or temporary retainer you might have to wear for the rest of your life.   \\nSo think about these 4 factors :   \\n1. Its a commitment for a few months, brushing, flossing, and also the discomfort of trays  \\n2. It might cost you anywhere between 2000 dollars to up to ...ugh i dunno 7000 dollars   \\n3. you will have to wear some kind of retainer after you are done with the trays for the rest of your life to maintain your newly aligned teeth  \\n4. Your friends and family will have mixed opinions about how your previous smile made you unique ( now that you have lost the gap)\\n\\nso the choice is yours ! and all the best!Some people feel their gap is part of who they are, makes them unique- if this is you: then no. If not, absolutely get Invisalign!Go for it. From what Ive read, gaps arent physiologically healthy in the long run.A lot of people forget to consider that teeth move over time. What\\'s barely acceptable \\\\[ to you \\\\] now, may be quite a lot worse in 5 years time, and you will be thinking you should have fixed them 5 years ago.\\n\\nIt will never be cheaper and easier than right now to fix them.Well, in my humble opinion youd look better if the gap wasnt there, so I say go for it. Also, if I were you (implying that cost & inconvenience werent obstacles), Id go for it as well. BUT many people appreciate their imperfections, and if youre one of them you shouldnt do Invisalign just to look better in other peoples eyes. Do what makes you happy!Ive had a gap my whole life, oddly enough was never made fun of in school or at any part of my life over it. Always was told I had a nice smile but when I took a photo I never showed my teeth and if I did Id notice right away and would hate the photo. Do it because you want to do it! Im still currently in the process and not loving my teeth still but hopefully I will when my journey is complete. Its a shame we see gaps in peoples teeth and always notice it and make fun of others because they arent straight, perfect and abnormally white. Society sadly makes us believe a œ standard for beauty œ but if it will make you happy go for it! Life is short :) I personally love your teeth! But again not about me, its about you and your happiness! ( Amy Winehouse, Mac Miller and Madonna all had gaps and personally they looked beautiful with them. Love yourself!I wouldn\\'t omit the gap, but making it smaller might be nice. Also, you\\'d get to straighten out your bottom teeth too.It depends on what you want! Personally, I decided to get mine primarily because of my gap, I always hated it!I\\'m on tray 5 out of 24. I have a similar gap and I think it does add to my uniqueness. I was concerned about my bottom teeth so I told my ortho I wanted to keep a small gap in the top and he said when I feel the gap is good enough we will stop and rescan if necessary. I was very conscious and nervous about invisalign but my bottom teeth were very separated and I think I made a wise decision without compromising my oral health and looks. Hope it helps.As someone who was fairly comfortable with my teeth before, do it, you wont regret itMy teeth were always my thing thar I obsessed over even though all things considered they werent œthat bad\\x9d. Had then straightened and tbh, theyre not perfect but theyre good enough. Have never thought twice about the cost on Invisalign because for me it was worth it in the end.You can keep the gap and we can still help you achieve more balance and harmony in your smile. \\n\\nDo you have a reverse smile arc as well as differences in the alignment of your upper teeth and a missing tooth in the upper left. Your lower incisors show moderate crowding as well simply aligning your teeth will bring more balance and harmony to your face. You can even keep the gap and balance it. \\n\\nWhere does the gap come from? Does the gap run in your family? Do you have a low hanging frenum or possibly an extra tooth called a mesiodens? \\n\\nAn orthodontist can help you with all of this, I highly recommend you go visit one certified by the board of orthodontics. A board-certified orthodontist has gone through the highest rigors of testing and proving their knowledge sufficient to have board certification.Yes, do it!I would close it if I were you.I think your gap is dope. If closing it would make you feel more confident then go for it, but I think it looks really good.Honestly if it bothers you do it! I had an overbite for most of my life and people would always tell me oh its not bad at all. I finally budged and straightened my teeth the confidence boost I got was unbelievable! I am no longer afraid of smiling ºï¸\\x8fI did Invisalign and made my gap smaller. But didnt close it all the way. You dont have to close it completely if you like it! I hated mine growing up now I love my gap. But it was def œtoo big\\x9d lol.Do it up!! You wont regret it. Well, for the first couple weeks youll be like omg what did I do ‚ but after that- no regrets!My middle daughter has a gap. I love it but if she wants to fix it when older its up to her. I think your gap is great and characterful and perhaps the lower teeth would be good a little straighter but its totally up to you. Only you know if its something that would add value to your lifeI say go for it ! I\\'m on tray 6 of 32 I have a deep bite . I was supposed to get braces as a child like many of us on here . My dentist suggested it because my teeth were applying so much pressure to my jaw and teeth that eventually my teeth would come out. When I\\'m done with my trays I am going to ask my dentist to shape my front teeth because they have those weird ridges(not sure what they\\'re called)  . They will have to file in between some space for some trays (I didn\\'t know that until I had it done ) anyhow I think you should do it for you and not worry about what everyone else thinks. We all have to start thinking about what we like instead of other peoples opinions. ºï¸\\x8fGo for it, you considered doing it but the opinions of others got to you. I was conscious of my smile and everyone said dont do it, but Im so happy I got Invisalign. The same people saying g my smile looks good. I think a good smile is priceless and the best thing you can do. If I was you yes I would do it.Do it! You wont regret. I promiseI made the decision to close mine at 51. If you smile alot in pictures showing teeth keep the gap and straighten the bottom. In my case I never smiled in pictures even as kid. I\\'m 33 weeks/ 7 months in with invisalign. Now that my gap is pretty much closed I smile now with attachment and retainers on.I seriously dont think a picture exists of me smiling with my teeth showing. I have received so much feedback from this post and I grateful for it. It has made the decision easier. I called and have an appointment on Monday to get scans done and Im going to proceed with this.I love your gap :)  F\\\\*\\\\*k Invisalign!  (I haven\\'t been that thrilled with my experience)Thank you Š. Im not sure I love it as much as you do though. What has your experience been like, if you dont mind me asking?Yeah, if you don\\'t love it then I suggest you change it up.  I really love the character, I think it\\'s so lovely.\\n\\nI\\'m being a whiner, my experience hasn\\'t been all that bad I suppose.  However, if I could go back in time, I would totally opt out.\\n\\nI am a 38 female, I had braces as a teenager so my teeth were fairly straight to begin with.  Because I haven\\'t been wearing a retainer like a chump, my teeth have slightly shifted and became misaligned.  Because my teeth are misaligned, I\\'m really biting down harshly on my left incisors and canine.  This bite is causing my gums to recede at a bit of an alarming rate.\\n\\nI initially was told it was $5000 CAD all in - my insurance would cover half, my dentist\\'s black Friday deal and would cover a quarter, so it\\'s fairly inexpensive for me to have this treatment.\\n\\nI started the Invisalign treatment, was told it would be 17 weeks.  The upper trays always felt a little loose, especially on my back teeth.  I was told my back uppers are crowns so they could not put the buttons or attachments on those teeth.  I believe that\\'s what caused them to be loose.  Almost a spongey kinda mouth feel.  Anyhoo!  I had four weeks left and noticed tray 13 felt more than a little loose on my back teeth.  I was told \"oh it\\'s fine, this can happen\".  I moved on to tray 14 which felt more loose than 13.  I went into the dentist and the hygienist/dental assistant put the tray under hot water and bent my Invisalign backwards thinking it would solve the problem.\\n\\nI just trusted them.  Who wouldn\\'t?!\\n\\nI\\'m feeling the home stretch as tray 15 goes on - but notice that my buttons (attachments) are not in place.  Back to the dentist I go.  They rescan my mouth and in two weeks, when I should be getting my Invisalign off, I\\'m getting another 12 weeks worth of trays.\\n\\nSupersonic annoying.  My new trays came with blue dots on the back teeth, which really are nice and snug on those crowns :)\\n\\nI guess to rain a little more on the Invisalign parade:  They are also not at all invisible, are difficult to speak in and was \\\\*JUST\\\\* told that I will need to wear a retainer everyday for a year after i\\'m through with Invisalign.  I\\'m super annoyed but hey \\\\*maybe, just maybe\\\\* i\\'ll be better to my gums.My opinion, is I like the gap it looks attractive.The two things Id consider are its harmony with your face and facial proportions (which we cant see here, there are celebrities that rock the front tooth gap), and whether it would help your confidence or not make much of a difference.Are you open to getting metal or ceramic braces or only Invisalign? I have clear and metal Damon braces for my severe crowding and they moved my teeth so fast.If I had a gap I wouldnt close it. I think as long as its ok for the over health of your teeth and purely cosmetic, there is no point. They are charming and unique. They add character. I vote keep it! But at the end of the day, if its a large source of insecurity, then close it.Get it done. Mine was so bad I had to do cosmetic dentistry to get it fixed. And I should have gotten it done way before I did.Its really up to you. If you like your gap, and its causing you no issues, you should keep it! \\n\\nIf it bothers you, get Invisalign :) \\n\\nIf it were me, I would want Invisalign. \\n\\nIve been thinking about how I would explain braces to my children if they ever need to get them; on the one hand Im hoping that they see and believe that looks are superficial. On the other hand, society judges people on looks and can even determine opportunities that are available to you. Teeth seems to be a big one. So just for those reasons, I would consider working on my teeth.\\n\\nETA they will make them look amazing when youre all done. Even if they look œbeaverish\\x9d, they can fix that too. Just look through all the before and afters here.Some people love their gaps, and some people hate them. Its hard for me to judge and say what I think you should do because I cant see your whole face. However, if they were my teeth, Id close the gap. \\n\\nIf you find yourself hiding your teeth or avoiding smiling because of the gap, get them fixed. If youre not self conscious about it, or if you like it, leave it.I had a crooked front tooth and crowding on the bottom front two teeth kind of like yours. i ended up getting invisalign mainly because I am an actor and fixing my crookedness makes me feel more comfortable being on camera.\\n\\nMy smile was never too bad and I always had people saying my smile is \"perfect\" \"beautiful\" etc. even when I had the crowding and crookedness. But I went ahead with invisalign for my own self love and acceptance and I haven\\'t been happier. I look at my smile now and feel like if i would have listened to others\\' thoughts i would always be secretly unhappy and judging myself.\\n\\nDon\\'t let others\\' thoughts about how you look keep you from creating a version of you that you\\'re happy with.its completely up to you but i say go for it! i had (have?) a large v-shaped gap in between my two front teeth and it made me so self conscious, i decided to go with Invisalign because it was suggested to me by my dentist and i dont regret my decision at all! my teeth are already halfway to touching and i only started mid-december! im already starting to become more confident and im not even half way done :)I am on tray 11/24 and closing a 3mm gap! I am 29 and have held onto the gap as part of my identity but have always wished I had a smile I felt confident about. Other people say they love my gap and I DO love that it gives my smile character, but for me I feel like it makes me look goofy when I smile and its always been something Im insecure about, as much as Ive tried to force myself to love it. Ironically I think gaps are so cute on others. Not to be too much of a broken records but as others have said its about your preference! Do you spend more days hating your smile than loving it? Also, you could probably keep your gap and treat everything else, or close the gap slightly to make it smaller. When I went in for consultation they told me they have some clients that plan treatment AROUND keeping their gap because they love it. Just a thought!Youd probably be a really good candidate. I recommend itI had big gaps and an open bite and in the refinement stage. You should do it I dont regret it one bit! You wont either. I love the gap. How do you feel about it?Coming from someone who also has a gap, Id close it. Im on tray 9/14 and its almost closed. Feels pretty insane how much of a difference it makes in your life. \\n\\nMy bf is sad because he loves my gap and its super sweet but I couldnt care less  its about me and what I want. Do what you want to have the best confidence in yourself everyday!I felt my spacing looked hick-ish and hated smiling in pictures because of it, so ask yourself how you feel about it, not others. I dont think your teeth will look too big pushed together but you can talk to the orthodontist about bonding to make your lateral incisors longer.I put off for years fixing my crooked bottom teeth. Many dentists suggested braces. Im fixing them now at age 57 with SureSmile. I should have done it years ago. A great smile is worth a million bucks. Im also doing this to protect my gums and correct a protruding back tooth.You can get them done but keen diastema. I have a patient keeping the front gap but otherwise wide ING the smile!My canines are set far forward and up high, and are quite pointy. When I would talk to people about getting braces or Invisalign, they would always say my vampire teeth are cute/unique/part of me. But I spent years hating my teeth, not smiling in pictures (œno REALLY smile, with your teeth!\\x9d), and feeling self conscious. Even as Ive gotten older and learned to embrace them a little more, I still felt like they make me less attractive, look less professional, etc., so I decided it doesnt matter if theyre part of my unique look. Theyre not a part of the look I want. I just started five weeks ago so I have a long way to go, but I cant wait to have a non-unique smile. When it comes down to it, its 100% your choice and you should do what makes you feel good!i would align both upper and lower but id do it with traditional bracesWhy would you suggest traditional?I had very similar teeth when I started out with Invisalign.

I am 95% done and going to do 1 more refinement and Ill be finished! Its worth it just make sure your dentist is a perfectionist! I didnt have one initially and switched at the end and she is now going above and beyond to help me! Your dentist matters so do not settle just because the price seems reasonable etc!Here are before/after pics of a scan by an Orthodontist. She says Invisalign will fix my teeth (overjet + slight cross bite) in about 2y. However, i met another Ortho for a second opinion and she says the better option for me would be permanent retainers. I'm confused which option to go with :(Im very confused by the 2nd consultation. Permanent retainers arent going to move your teeth. Is that ortho suggesting no treatment for some reason?My bad, i meant Traditional braces, I'm still learning the terms sorry. She said the traditional ones could work better for me. And it could be a much shorter & faster treatment than InvisalignIn the after pic  your molars are no longer meeting properly will this be an issue?No actually, it would be in perfect class I molarAh ok, I did not know so thought to ask.

I had braces in high school, so my teeth looked almost perfect still, I could just tell they were slowly moving forward. I had 3 different quotes (2 from different dentists and 1 from an orthodontist). I ended up choosing the orthodontist - the treatment time was longer but they specialize in teeth movement so I felt more comfortable with a specialist. I had to have rubber bands for a while to bring my teeth back, but they didnt bother me and I was really good about wearing them.

I have an appointment soon so I will ask about what can be done about the bite.Looks great but molars need to touchNo I would not. I currently have an open bite and waiting for refinement trays. I would put myself in braces to fix that. I hate that I cant chew food properly because my molar dont touch.This is my worry. Midway through and molars dont touch much at all anymoreIf it gives you any hope I started off a pretty decent posterior open bite and after 20 refinements its gotten a lot better and its now as per the photos above so Invisalign does seem to work. I think Ive just lost patience in the process hahaYea I can imagine doing the same … But then I look at my starting photo and itll be worth it. I have overlapping and in and out teeth. Ill feel weird when theyre straight. Once I can eat though, seeing as thats what teeth are for „Its the best feeling looking back!! Its sooo worth it.

Has anyone here switches from braces to invisalign? My smile was fine before so i speculate the adjustments/movements i need in my teeth are minor so i think invisalign would suffice.

Which might be good for some people, but not me. Normally I drink a lot of non water drinks \\n\\nMy speech IS affected, and I tend to take the top tray out for meetings so I'm not lisping through whole meetings. This results in less than optimal trays-on-teeth times. \\n\\nThere are still elastics, which were a total surprise for me. Since one of the bonding points was on a crown, which can't support glued pegs, I have to through a weird dance to get an elastic to clip onto the tray itself - something Invisalign didn't anticipate to build into the trays.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSO... I think I would have been better off with braces. Your milage may vary.Another bonus for Invisalign is that it protects your teeth from the improper bite you ate trying to correct so your teeth dont wear down the plastic doesI had braces many years ago and now just started with invisalign. They both suck, just in different ways tbh Invisalign does have the benefit of being a little more discrete in terms of appearance. I have these bite ramps things behind my front teeth though, so I don't know that I'll ever get rid of this lisp so long as I'm wearing these aligners. I also have lots of attachments on my teeth, which everyone says you get used to it eventually. But they're there, food can get caught in them. Right now, the insides of my cheeks are kind of raw (still on the first tray). So yes, you can take the aligners out, but it's not like there isn't anything there. On the flip side, you're not supposed to eat with the aligners in, so right now it has totally cut down on any snacking. Im lucky I can work at home, so taking the trays in and out during the day is not so bad. My kids have braces and pretty much can eat whenever they want. And for me, my ortho told me it would be the same amount of time with braces or invisalign. \\nNot everyone has the bite ramps and lots of attachments. Which one is better really depends on your specific case and your lifestyle in terms of being able to remove/rinse trays when you need to eat.

The ortho who did my braces when I was younger told me I should go back into braces instead of Invisalign and now I see why. I went to the top ortho in LA who speaks at Invisalign conferences all the time. I asked him if I should do Invisalign or braces, because I wanted what would give me the best result and he recommended Invisalign. My teeth definitely dont look at good as after I got my braces off and my bite was off whenever I was done with Invisalign treatment.Im learning this the hard way \\xadI dont have anything constructive to add other than telling you I can also commiserate because Im 17/20 trays in and not satisfied at all and am pretty bummed about my dentist saying the results I want arent achievable..?! >:(I know a lot of people including me wish they had teeth as great as yoursbeyond first world problemsYes, first world problems for sure.

HELP!So I just got my invisalign this week.  **On my 3rd day**.  I had braces when I was a kid but like an idiot, I didn\\'t wear my retainer and of course my teeth shifted.  Not to where they once were, but enough that I decided to go the invisalign route as an adult.\\n\\nAnyway, about once a month, I go out with friends for dinner and drinks.  As a 38 year old wife, mother, and career woman, these nights bring life to me! HAHA \\n\\nAnyway, my biggest concern is that we obviously can\\'t eat or drink while wearing the aligners.  When I go out, it\\'s usually between 8pm-2am.  Like I said, we start at a nice restaurant then head to a bar for some drinks.  That is normally about 6 hours on a Friday night.\\n\\nIf I have to remove my aligners during this time, will my teeth shift drastically when I try to put the aligners back on?  I\\'m a beer drinker.  I prefer beer over wine or liquor.  So I know if I try keeping my aligners on while at the bar having a few beers, it\\'s probably going to stain them and maybe even cause cavities.  \\n\\nI really don\\'t want to give up on my girls night out once a month but I also don\\'t want to add more time to my treatment.  Anyone have any suggestions or things they do when they go out for dinner and drinks?So a few options:\\n\\n1) wear your aligns when you can while you are out. e.g. wear them to the resto then take out right before you eat/drink and put them back in. It\\'s annoying but possible.\\n\\n2) Take them out for the entire night but likely you\\'ll need to tack an extra day or two on that tray (this is what my dentist suggested)\\n\\n3) Drink with trays in and only take them out to eat. Rinse trays by having water following each drink and when you go the bathroom pop them out to rinse. \\n\\nI\\'d go with option 3 personally.Thank you so much!  Number 3 seems like the least annoying of all the other options LOL.  I\\'ll have to go with that one.Yes #3 is what I do! Has always worked fine. Also now that I\\'m a little further into things I\\'m so much quicker with popping the trays in and out that the public washroom invisalign trips hardly faze me hahaJust take them out for the night. Option 2 is perfectly fine. Ive done this quite a few times and teeth always tracked okNumber 3 is also great for if you get knocked in the face by a drunk person. I can barely eat solid foods let alone take an elbow to the teeth without my aligner onId go for nr 3!Ive had them a year and if Im out Ill always drink with them in. Id rather do that than take it out hours at a time. \\n\\nHave never had a problem.I would do option 3 too. I drink a lot of different bevs with mine in and just rinse when Im done!I was pretty anal about driving only water with them in during the first two weeks. I quickly got over that and will drink any clear or light colored beverage (beer, g&t, white wine, sparkling water, etc) with them in and rinse with water.A straw will do you wonders with those drinks.Since you first started, you\\'re probably super concerned about the whole no drinking with them in, wear them for 22 hours a day, whatever else. I was like that initially but then I learned to just live life. There\\'s been a few times when I removed them for a night out and didn\\'t bother putting them back in until morning. The dentist never noticed and I\\'m not having any issues.\\n\\nThat said though, it was recommended by my dentist that you add on an extra day if you do this.This actually brings me lots of comfort!  LOL  Thank you for that.No problem. Your mileage may vary though. Some people are more prone to cavities, or their teeth may be stubborn. Regardless, invisalign shouldnt put too much of a damper, if any, on your monthly ritual.\\n\\nYou may notice the trays get a bit tighter if you leave them off for the night but it shouldnt be a cause for concern if they still fit (which they will).Youre better off taking them out for the night rather than drinking with them in. Drinking with them in makes cavities more likely as the sugars will be sitting next to your teeth all night.Id take them out right before eating and put them back in after. Drink water after every sip of any beverage but leave them in. Brush teeth and aligners well at home and floss. Avoid drinks that can strain your aligners though.I\\'ve taken mine out for the entire evening,  but am sure to clean my teeth and put them back in before bed.  They fit a little tight when I put them back in,  but by the morning  everything is fine.   Ortho says I am making great progress.   Just don\\'t take them out for long periods frequently.I drink all the time with my aligners in. Just don\\'t drink red wine...Fellow 38 year old mom here. I start my journey in 3 weeks and have my husband\\'s 20th HS reunion 2 days later so I have the same concerns!Depends on how often you change your aligners. I am changing every 4 days and I drink with aligners on, take them off right before I eat (yes, at the table right in front of everyone and nobody cares, you can go to the toiled if you want and rinse them before you put them away). After eating I just rinse my mouth and run my tongue over my teeth to make sure no food is stuck, put aligners back on and keep drinking. No staining or cavities so far. Of course I brush when Im back home. \\n\\nI have also had my aligners off for over 10 hours in a few occasions with no major issues. I still changed them on day 4 as scheduled.I go out a LOT, and quickly realized that it\\'s not feasible to be worrying about my aligners all night. I just drink with them in, and rinse with water on the bathroom if i remember. Honestly, a lot of times I\\'m too drunk to brush my teeth before I pass out at home lol. Feels gross in the morning but ive never gotten stains or any other issues. Just live life I drink with my trays in all the time.  It\\'s been fine.  Enjoy!I drink beer and white wine with my alingers in, its never been an issue just clean them thoroughly at the end of the nightFor 2 years I drank any and everything with them in and never had an issue. Especially with beer youll be fine.Ive had Invisalign for 6 months and just take them out to eat and then have them in for the drinking/socializing part of the evening. Thats worked out perfectly and I dont have issues with staining or cavities. Having a glass of water on hand to swish every once in a while is a good practice. \\n\\nYou will get used to this quickly and it wont put a damper on your time out.Beer (blonde ones at least) won\\'t stain your aligners, from my own experience. \\n\\nIdk about cavities though. Once in a while probably won\\'t hurt! Just drinks some water in between as well.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t take them out for 6 hours, only for the dinner part :)I would never take them out for 6h! If I have mine  out for more than an hour it hurts to put them back in, especially if I do it more than once at the same day.\\n\\nI always change trays on Sundays. It feels more ok to have a drink or two with the trays in when I know Im going to change them soon.I\\'m wondering if it has to do with how many attachments one has. The thought of having my trays out (18 of 19 currently) for more than an hour makes my skin crawl because it will just tear up the inside of my mouth because now, 18 trays in, my teeth are a little closer to the inside of my mouth and the attachments just tear it up.So I started Invisalign around Christmas time. My ortho said due to the nature of Christmas day, if I cant wear them for the 20-22 hours, wear them for an additional day (I change mine weekly). So whenever I have had life events, this is what I have done and I am tracking fine. I dont particularly enjoy doing it, so I generally eat a meal, drink water and I dont drink alcohol just now either. But if you want to do that, just wear an additional day to the period set by your Ortho!\\n\\nId chat with the Ortho with any concerns too! Hope this helpsI drink beer with my aligners in\\n\\nIf it were me, I would enjoy my beer before dinner. Take my trays out to eat. Brush, rinse etc as usual and put them back in. Continue to drink the beer for the evening with the trays in, swishing with water as I went. Then take them out and clean them and your teeth really really good before putting them back in. \\n\\nKeep in mind, this is just what I would do. Everyone is different. But I had my first cleaning since starting invisalign and my hygienist said \"whatever you are doing, keep it up! Everything looks great!\"\\n\\nMom\\'s night out is crucial!\\n\\nEdited to add - maybe try to plan these nights out more towards the end of whatever tray you are on, so possible staining isn\\'t as big of a deal. And I use polident retainer if mine stain, and that cleans them right up! ŠŠŠI drank gin and tonic or gin and soda water with mine in and didn\\'t have any problems. Just swished water after every drink and did a full clean as soon as I got home. Dentist said clear spirits was fine to drink with aligners inJust dont eat with aligner in, drinking is fine as long as it isnt hot drink.\\n\\nAnd actually, you can eat with aligner (but not recommended for everyone) it just hard to chew.Order some Splat oral care foam from Amazon. This will be your saviour. Drink with trays in and when you go to the toilet get your splat out and rinse with the trays in. You can do this in the cubicle and spit it down the toilet rather than having to stand at the sinks with everyone around you. I use Splat all the time, I couldn\\'t have done this without itI normally just take them out to eat, quick swish with some mouthwash in the bathroom and pop them back in for drinks.

I use the Y shaped one to help seat the aligners each time I put them in. The little tube shaped ones I use to chew on for a few minutes a day because I keep hearing œit helps\\x9d. I only bought a 24 pack of those, but at the rate Im going through them I probably should have gotten a much larger pack.

I know how much it hurt my self esteem. Itll be great!What do you mean by not knowing the treatment plan? You should have been provided a video that shows how your teeth will be moved?im not sure why you got downvoted. if my dentist didnt show me my video and talk me through the whole process before i committed, i would have sought a second opinion.I have no idea. It was a legitimate question I had. The clincheck video is part of the Invisalign process. I hope OP asks for that bc it should be available & provided to her. I previewed the video before I signed an agreement & paid. I would not have agreed to move forward if I didnt know what the treatment plan was.My ortho didnt send it till I asked. (They are understaffed and have generally been horrible about communicating.) OP should ask!Some don't get it until they pick up their trays, some don't get it at allI was wondering the same thing. I was emailed my clincheck (treatment plan) as soon as I approved it. My Dr. showed it to me before ordering my first set of trays.\\n\\nOP, ask your Dr. to email your treatment plan. They shouldn't be withholding this info from you.It will definitely hurt for a while, but that should lessen over time. Your teeth might be a little sore after changing to the next aligner but nothing unbearable. Dont worry if you dont see progress right away because it can be slow, but it definitely is working! One day youll look in the mirror and be like œ holy crap! I can see a difference now!\\x9d Such a good feeling. Good luck on your journey ŠCongratulations on starting the journey. Take it one day at a time. As everyone else has said it will get better every day.  Try and wear them for as long as possible. Tray minder has been a good friend to me ........All the best!!!!Ur making the right move.Ibuprofen will be your friend. Don't start a new tray the day before something important, I had to switch my trays one day later because I work in office on Wednesday, and my new tray made my jaw ache so bad I had to go home early, was even crying in my car. Though mind you, long acting dull achey pain is much worse for me than sudden sharp pain. It's more of a will thing for me I guess? Like it becomes such a neusance it makes me upset. \\nEach new tray hurts less though.\\nI still can't really eat hard or chewy foods the first two days with my new trays. So keep it simple. And avoid curry or anything with tumeric or yellowish staining pigment. Probably stay away from beets too. I had curry rice the first week and it stained my buttons yellow. Luckily I found a whitening pen that actually worked, but it took a few days to get my teeth back to where they were. \\nI also like to keep my Invisalign In a cup of peroxide and water while I eat to make sure they're extra clean. Try to keep your trays in for 23 hours. It's not always possible and that's ok. I've been a little less good with them lately cos I eat in the car on the way to work, but I try to not leave them out too long for multiple days. \\nAlso plan your meals. Snacking becomes tedious because you need to brush your teeth every time after. So make sure you're eating plenty of filling stuff in one sitting. \\nOne last thing: I switched from a soft to a medium toothbrush because the soft brush wasn't getting my back teeth super clean. It's irritating at first, and make sure to be gentle around your gums. And floss when you can. Don't want to get cavities in your soon to be straight teeth. Best of luck!My ortho specifically asked me to use paracetamol if needed, and not ibuprofen. Apparently there is some evidence that suggests ibuprofen hinders the movement of the teeth. Have any of you heard similar comments?It has to do with the inflammation. Ibuprofen relieves inflammation specifically but the extra blood flow and swelling (also known as inflammation) is actually necessary for the good health of the roots and it speeds up the tooth movement. Chewies are good pain relief for that persistent dull acheI've never heard such a thing but I know just taking too much ibuprofen in general isn't a great idea so I try to switch up whichever NSAIDS I'm using to avoid any issues. Also my teeth are moving surprisingly fast. I'm on day 3 of my new liner and it snapped on really easy.This is what my dentist said, also.I like to change my trays first thing in the morning of my tray change. I get through it during the day, Rather than do like most people and changing them before bed and wake up still achey and sore. But thats just me.\\n\\nYoull find what works for you.Get some dental wax, chewies, and an ortho key. Getting them on and off your teeth might be a little difficult the first week but it gets easier and easier. The trays will probably rub the inside of your mouth in uncomfortable ways and the dental wax will feel heavenly when you're trying to go to sleep at night. Chewies will be good for keeping your trays tight, teeth moving quickly, and natural pain relief.\\nWatch a lot of YouTube videos. There are so many reviews and testimonials and I think you'll be much better prepared to get through that first week if you listen to people talking about what it was like. I think your teeth will end up gorgeous and your smile will be Hollywood ready. Just know, it will be nothing but regret for the first week. But those growing pains don't last long. Good luck! And congratulations!This will be a fascinating one to see through. I look forward to your updates!Id like to add that if a tray is really cutting up your mouth, use a nail file on the edges. I had to do that on several trays, and my ortho told me to do that if needed. I bought Crest Aligner Care tablets to soak them every morning, and my trays stay nice n clear. Chapstick will be your best friend. Mountain Oceans Lip Trip is the absolute best, followed closely by Portland Bee Balm.You might start out having a bit of discomfort seeing how your teeth are positioned. Just know it's a process and you will be glad you did it.  You've got plenty of support right here on REDDIT!! You will be just fine.1. Water, lots of water. Drink tons of it. I used to be a snacker and had to give it up because I didn't want to have to go through the whole floss/brush routine between meals. Also, removing and putting the trays in can be very painful during the first couple of days, so I would just OMAD if it was particularly painful. \\n\\n2. Use tray cleaner tablets at least once a day. You can let the trays soak while you are eating. I started breaking the tablets in half to make them last longer. Brushing with water isn't enough to keep them from getting smelly, at least for me.Ä° just started Invisalign 2 weeks ago. I'm on my second tray now. Ä°t's been a huge change. No snacking that much. But I'm sure it will be worth it in the end. Or well i hope.

There is a reason a Rolex watch costs more than the one at Walmart \\nGo with either traditional braces or with Invisalign. Do NOT use the mail order shit that costs a fraction of the price - there is a reason they can charge so little.

I'm yet to experience more than a 1/10 mild discomfort pain and even that is only while taking out the trays for the first time and I'm on tray 5/40.\\n\\nI've seen people with worse cases talk about pain yet have significantly less trays than myself, meaning they'd have more movement per tray. I'd assume the more movement you have in each tray change, the more pain it's likely to cause whereas small movements are almost completely unnoticeable in terms of pain or discomfort.I've thought a very similar thing. Not sure if I'm just lucky or high tolerance or what. I have seen people say that the first few trays are loosening everything up but don't do any of the proper movements. Whilst the first one or two can be the worst, things can also get a lot more painful around 5-8 as other movements start.\\n\\nSo basically, I'm waiting for the hammer to drop lol.

Yes it hurts bad on change day but nothing will ever compare to tightening day with braces. …Overcorrection trays are the last few trays of treatment. Not sure if everyone gets them though. What they do is push your teeth past perfect (over correct)so the teeth will rebound to a perfect position when the aligners are removed. They also just tighten everything up at the end. Not sure what the person before me is talking about unless over correction Is different for everyone? I do know they are your last 3-5 trays. Once you get your last trays you can check if you have them or not by looking for a little plus on the bag!Sorry for being a noob, but are these not refinements?I had trouble figuring out the difference too! Over correction are apart of your original planned out trays. They literally just continue to tighten up past the finished results from your first set. Refinements are when you are done and need a new scan and get a whole new set of trays to fix whatever still needs fixing if you and your ortho arnt completely happy with the finished results ! Not great at explaining it but there are lots of posts somewhere deep on this subreddit about the difference if you are still confused!\\n\\nExample. I have 18 trays. The last 3 of those 18 are planned out to be overcorrection. \\n\\nAnything passed 18 of my original treatment, I would have to get rescanned for refinements.

Thank you for taking the time to explain it to me :) I will check my planWhen my teeth were doing major shifting the trays were pretty painful at first.

Ideally you still wear a plastic retainer at night, since they don\\'t stop movement in all directions. A lot of people also seem to have them break, and they are a little more difficult to floss around.Permanent retainers only usually go from canine to canine, so all premolars and molars are still free to move around if the removable retainer isn\\'t worn. You generally can\\'t floss with them but you can use interdental brushes. The breakages are usually between the canine and lateral tooth.[deleted]I used brushes for mine, it was a lot easier :D brushes are better than floss overall (according to every dentist, hygienist and periodontist I\\'ve worked with) so if you can use them, then it\\'s worth using them.Permanent retainer would allow you to wear your removable retainer nights only from the start. No need for 6 months of full time wear since the wire holds your teeth during the day but alone they don\\'t hold well enough so a removable retainer is also needed.Mine offered me a replacement package of up to five retainers for a few hundred extra bucks.  Once she told me that a single replacement usually costs upwards of $250, I went ahead and bought in.  The new style aren\\'t wire and acrylic like they used to be when I was a teenager.  They will wear down.That\\'s a great deal! I wish my high school ortho in the 90s offered something like that.I wore my last set for 4 years (I moved and didn\\'t find a new orthodontist to take over since I was already done). I used peroxide and alcohol interchangeably to regularly clean them with a ultrasonic cleaner I got on Amazon. The biggest advice I can give is to gently remove them, don\\'t just yank them at the easiest spot because they will begin to crack over time from that.Per my dentist instruction\\n\\nAt Forest Family Dentistry, four sets of Vivera retainers are included after your treatment. The\\nfirst retainer must be worn for 3 months to allow the bone and ligaments to reharden. Without\\nwearing a retainer during this time the teeth may shift and move back to their original position. It is important to wear your retainers for 22 hours a day during this time. They should be removed during eating and drinking.\\n\\nAfter 3 months, please dispose of this first set of retainers. You will then move onto your\\nsecond set for nighttime use only. Invisalign predicts that each set of retainers may last one year.\\n\\nWe recommend after one year trying your third set of retainers. If they feel similar continue wearing the second set until a difference is felt.\\n\\nMy understanding is that trashing the first one after 3 months is because it will be stained from wearing it pretty much non stop.I think retainer wear depends on the Ortho.  I was told to wear mine 12 hours a day when I received them, but read it\\'s recommended to wear them 22 hours for 3 to 6 months.Ideally every day for months, then just to nights. But yes, indefinitely. If you want to maintain your results, you\\'ll wear them every night forever and get replacements every 3-15yrs depending on how you are with them.  Everyone\\'s mouth and jaw is different.Retainers (or your last tray) should be worn full time for 6 months after orthodontic treatment, whether its braces or Invisalign. Then switch to only at night. Every single dentistry article online will tell you to do so.This makes sense to me.  I guess my question is more how long should a retainer last?Clear retainers last 1-3 years, maybe longer with excellent care... likely shorter if you\\'re a clencher/grinder. \\n\\nIf you\\'re a bruxer, especially nighttime, you should get a full coverage hard acrylic nightguard made by your dentist (it only needs to be one arch). And have it adjusted to fit your occlusion with opposing retainer. \\n\\nAnother option is to get Hawley retainers. They have a longer lifespan. But they do not hold the teeth as well.And hard/impossible to have proper tongue posture (on the roof of the mouth) overnight with a Hawley in.I got married  in the middle of my program so my ortho put me on a \"pause\". I pretty much did the same thing you are. 22 hours a day but it was only for a month. I used denture cleaning tabs and it really helped keeping them clean.

I just wear my retainer at night as per her instructions. She had me start that from day 1 of the retainer.My daughter had traditional braces but an invisalign like retainer.

Lots of different opinions it seems. My dentist said full time wear for 4-6 weeks and then night time only. I chose to go a bit longer. For me personally, I wore my retainer most of the day for a the first few months. I am now about 5 months post invisalign. I recently started only wearing them at night, based on how my teeth feel when I put the retainer back in. I can tell if I have the retainer out too long. It will feel especially tight. I have noticed I can now go all day without and then when I put the retainer in at night it is only a slight pressure felt for a minute or two. Am I doing it right? I have no idea. But my teeth have not shifted and they don\\'t feel wobbly anymore. My bite has also settled, which took a few months.My dentist said 22 hours daily for one month, then nights only forever.Id suggest getting a fixed retainer for the awkward teeth - then wear retainer each night after a few weeks of 24/7.FWIW, I have a bottom Essix(?) clear retainer that I have worn nightly since 2013. I slept with my mouth open and ground my teeth while asleep for at least 5 of those years.

Keep in mind that I am not a doctor and this is just my experience. I hope that it helps some of you. \\n\\nBackground: I am 31 years old, I have crowding in my front top and bottom row of teeth, I have always wanted to œfix them\\x9d so I finally took the plunge. I am working with Dr. Jaw in Tucson AZ and the whole thing cost roughly $ 5,000.00. I did consider braces but decided for Invisalign since the cost would be almost identical and I am vain (also doc told me that we could flip to braces in the middle of Invisalign for a small price change anyway?). I was issued 23 trays, I am on tray 20, for the first round of adjustments but I am told I will need another set for œrefinements\\x9d. Ok, here goes a bunch of œshower thoughts\\x9d in no particular order:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* **Invisalign will make your bite change.** Make sure you bite at % 60 power day after you change your retainer. I, unfortunately, lost a filling a few trays in since my bite changed to the point that the pressure on my molars was being put in different places that I was not used to which made one of my fillings fall off. I had to spend a lot of back and forth getting it fixed and my Ortho and I were worried we might have to re-order trays to make sure they fit again. Thankfully, it was fixed with no need for new trays! *Disclaimers: it was an old filling, I am a  teeth grinder and did chip tiny pieces of my tooth along the way because of the bite changes. A bigger lesson was learned here about taking it easy on the stress lol.*\\n* **Change your retainer right before bed.** Invisalign has been painful, but not nearly as much as I pictured it would. The most painful trays were definitely the first five trays, give or take. But, after a while, they are just a bit uncomfortable and more of a nuisance than anything else. Yes, you can take some pain meds but I did not find it to be necessary. With that said, it might be worth keeping in mind that, from what I read, *œNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs block prostaglandin synthesis and result in slower tooth movement.****\\x9d*** \\\\- [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3467920/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3467920/).  I understand this is silly to consider but, if over thinking was a treat, I would be writing to you from the Biggest loser right now. \\n* **Hygiene** wise, make sure that you wash your retainers with soap not toothpaste. Toothpaste will œcrystalize\\x9d, harden, stain and make your retainers look bad. I know its a little strange sounding, but wash your retainers with soap! I use [Dr bronner's liquid soap](https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Bronners-Pure-Castile-Liquid-Soap/dp/B000HJXQ9G/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3KU0M4OY0WEPK&keywords=Dr%2Bbronner%27s%2Bliquid%2Bsoap&qid=1653429082&sprefix=dr%2Bbronner%27s%2Bliquid%2Bsoap%2Caps%2C119&sr=8-4&th=1). Buy a mouth guard sonic washer, I got the [F3900 Ultrasonic](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HLBW61C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1), this will be helpful in the long run since you are going to get a nightguard anyway! I will wash my retainer once or twice a day with the soap using just a regular manual toothbrush, specifically put aside for this purpose. I rinse and put the tray in the sonic washer for one cleaning cycle while I brush my teeth. This is probably not exactly Invisalign related but, my answer to that scene in Fight Club for œWho would you fight, alive or dead\\x9d would be my dentist. And since your teeth œsit\\x9d in the guard which is full of saliva and bacteria, I use Fluoride mouthwash to help re-mineralization as an antagonizer to the prolonged exposure to bacteria. I am not looking to get any more fillings. I use [alcohol free Listerine](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054J2GDQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&th=1).  \\n* **Be your own advocate.** Oftentimes there were things I wasnt paying attention to because I assumed my orthodontist, or their assistants at least, would be keeping an eye out for. For example, a few of my button anchors fell off without me noticing until a few days later. I did not commit it to memory because I assumed it would be brought up on my next check up. I left the Ortho office and realized I had forgotten to bring it up and they did not mention it either. Remember that you have to be your own advocate for your teeth. Now, I noticed a small gap forming in my front two teeth and I brought it up since I stopped assuming they would notice it and it is now being addressed! \\n* **On the move** I keep a small tooth brushing kit with a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss and rubber bands in the car or in my œday bag\\x9d. I do also carry a small Listerine but that might be overkill. My current kit is [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005SRS8TK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1) . I do rinse with water as soon as I am done eating, and wait about 20 minutes or so before brushing my teeth to allow for œre-mineralization\\x9d. I do not eat or drink anything other than clear liquids with my retainer since I have found them to stain. I will become more flexible as I approach the next retainer change but consuming human food with retainers makes you feel like you are a T-1000 trying to convince your friends that youre œjust like them\\x9d. \\n\\nAs a closing thought; do it! If you are on the fence about getting Invisalign, just do it. I was dreading the length of time and the amount of work it would take but I am so glad I did it. It feels like I took the plunge just a few months ago and I am now, at least, half way through the whole thing. You might as well get it out of your mind if its taking so much mental real estate. But, take it from a worrier, I am sure something else will come take its place lol.

After 1 year of Invisalign my dentist failed and recommended metal braces.My mistake was getting Invisalign through my dentist instead of an orthodontist. I had metal braces almost 30 years ago when I was like 12. I didnt have a retainer anymore and I felt 2 of my front teeth were rubbing against each other and inquired about Invisalign. My dentist was certified to do Invisalign, she game me a consolation, and I decided to move forward with it for the long term benefit. I ended up going with the comprehensive plan and also needed to get retainer and night guard for which I paid upfront for. I had 1 set of realignments and luckily the 2nd time showed I didnt need to shave anything off. Great, I was on track to be done by May, for a total of 8 months.\\n\\nIn early May, in my 3rd last tray, I commented on how the front was a little uneven. My dentist took another set of impressions and set off for what I thought another round of realignment. She realized that my teeth were not sitting on top of eachother and in the back they were not even touching. That would explain me not being able to chew very well but I though for sure it would be resolved by the time I am done. \\n\\nIt took over 3 months to hear back, she was first saying that Invisalign was having delays, then to have me come in and get another set on impressions for their office reference, and then finally sitting me down and saying that the only way to fix the gap was going to be traditional braces and if not my teeth would never line up. She recommended I get a 2nd opinion from an orthodontist who has more experience.  As you can imagine, I was pretty frustrated. \\n\\nA month later I was finally able to see the new doctor. That was 3 weeks ago. It seems like he may potentially be able to fix it, still with Invisalign, with the use of rubber bands and that it will likely take another 8-9 months to do so. He took new scans and I'm supposed to hear back soon. (although after 2 weeks they called me realizing they don't have my transfer form so there went another 2 weeks) - but hopefully I will get some resolution soon.\\n\\nSo my initial 8 months will now take almost 2 years in total, and I have been wearing the same freaking trays for 4 months now. \\n\\nDo I have any recourse on this?

Frustrating to spend all of this money for really crappy treatment.I dont have any advice, but I did a year and a half of Invisalign and now I have metal brackets on my bottom teeth. They just werent getting there, and my ortho said he thought that wed get better results from a few months of fixed braces than more trays. (I kind of wish Id just gone for the fixed braces from the beginning, TBH. Id be done by now!)Mine couldnt do metal braces, so at the end they quoted me nearly 6k for CROWNS citing a very minor chip repair I had done previously as the reason that was warranted (Im 25. I should have 40 years at least with my teeth). They claimed they would never look straight unless I did the crowns.

And is it worth the extra money?I would say that Invisalign price is reasonable in my area - for comparison, I'm paying closer to $5,000 for only 8 months of treatment.\\n\\nWhat are the reasons you would prefer Invisalign over braces?\\n\\nI think a lot of the decision making can come from are you bothered by the appearance of traditional braces? I think many of us who choose Invisalign do so to AVOID the look of metal but I'm nearing middle age and my decision was for pure vanity's sake!!\\n\\nWhile both have their own unique maintece concerns, it's nice not having to come in monthly for monitoring (whereas with tightening of braces, I would likely be coming in regularly).\\n\\nI agree about getting another estimate - just to make sure it is a fair price.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nETA: I don't know age and working situation, but I would wonder if offering to contribute a bit towards the difference would reflect your dedication to the decision.Thank you for taking the time to write all of that!\\n\\nThe reason, I absolutely HATE the way braces look. Every time I look at someone with them on, I immediately notice them. No offense to anyone who likes braces but I think they are really ugly and a total deal breaker for me.\\n\\nAnother reason, I hear people say they are a lot more painful than invis. Now I have been doing my research and I understand that invis is painful to but not near as bad. Also I like the fact of being able to eat whatever you want. And(and this is kinda weird) but I feel like it would be fun and cool in a way to have all the packs of invis that I have to keep track of and to have a neat little case for them(I am wierd like that, I like having responsibilities)\\n\\nAnd regarding your last comment about offering to pay, I have in fact brought that up to my parents. I have ~500 in cash sitting in my drawer and I have $150 in wrapped coins AND at least $300 in unwrapped coins that I have to sort soon.\\n\\nIf you put those together, its almost 1k dollars which is a great chunk of the price BUT they keep refusing to accept my money because I will need it for college(I am currently a sophomore in high school) and I will probably get a job when I am 16.\\n\\nSo yeah, thats my situation rn. I have done tons of research and literally everything they asked the ortho about, I already told them about.\\n\\nThe main thing that is troubling them is the price and my dedication. My dad also says that having them in will give me a GIANT lisp. I know you get a temporary lisp but he is majorly exaggerating it and it is annoying :/You sound like you're really putting in some research here which I think indicates a great level of responsibility already. \\n\\nI don't blame you one bit about not wanting braces because of the appearance. If that had been my only alternative, I likely wouldn't have had them. \\n\\nI do believe I tend to have a lisp - but usually when it's time to change them. I've not had one person comment on it and I think most people don't care.\\n\\nIn these subs, I've seen prices vary considerably (2k at times). Perhaps in your area, if you have more providers who offer free consultations, going to several others may result in a better cost savings. Best of luck to you. Hopefully you can find a lower price point that will make both you and your family pleased. :)Thank you!(I forgot to respond lol )\\n\\nA little update: I wrapped *most* of my coins and I have $418. I still have a bunch more though so I will have well above $500.\\n\\nI told this to my dad and we had a nice discussion about it and he said that since I did a lot of research and I presented it to him in a mature way and that I am helping pay, **he is going to get me Invisalign**\\n\\nI am so freaking happy right now I cant even express it. Thank you for all the info and Ill update you even now if you would like!!Thats cheaper than my Invisalign and I had a Â500 off offer. But I still wish Id done braces - thats just me.\\n\\nThe annoyance of constant brushing and cleaning trays every time I ate and drink just has really got to me mentally. On top of that I dont think I will get the results I dreamed of. I already know Ill have the treatment extended from 22 trays (2 week changes) to more refinements again. Plus I ended up with attachments on so many teeth theyre obviously visible anyway. Less visible than braces, sure, but I just wonder if braces would have been quicker and more effective with less stress around drinking tea with them in etc.\\n\\nI think the lifestyle changes required with Invisalign are harder than a lot of people make out. Just to give you a real perspective I wish Id had before I started.\\n\\nIf you are a really dedicated person with a very strong ability to stick to a new routine without fail every day then maybe theyd be ok. But otherwise Id get braces if I had my choice again.Thats very interesting, thank you!Im paying $200 down- $200 monthly payment for something like 26 months and the total amount comes out to $5,185 and this is for 12-18 months of treatment! Another ortho quoted me the same amount of treatment time but required $500 down, I dont remember the monthly payment amount but the total was $6,300. I would get a second opinion from another ortho!I had braces when I was 12, never finished my treatment because I moved countries (although I was almost done) and then never wore my retainers, so my teeth are crooked again. I'm doing Invisalign now and I'll say the pain is the same. The second and third day of wearing my first aligners were very painful. I let myself starve until I couldn't take it anymore before eating because I didn't want to take my aligners out due to the pain. When I had braces as a kid, I was in pain for a total of 3 days and that was it. So, I'd say it's pretty much the same.\\n\\nWhen I decided to get orthodontic treatment again, I was actually leaning more towards braces, because the idea of having to take the aligners out every time I eat and drink anything other than water and then floss, brush and clean the aligners before putting them back in and having to wear them for 22 hours a day sounded much too annoying, but after my consultation, the results was that Invisalign would be faster for me (12-15 months with Invisalign vs 16-22 months with braces). Also, I wouldn't have any restrictions on food and I wouldn't have to go back to the orthodontist as often. So in the end I decided to go with Invisalign.\\n\\nBut after starting Invisalign I've realized that my teeth are much too sore to eat anything that you aren't supposed to eat when you have braces anyway, so that advantage is not really an advantage. Also, if your main concern about braces is the way it looks, there are ceramic brackets that are tooth colored and aren't as noticeable. You have to get attachments with Invisalign anyway and if you get a lot of attachments, there won't be too much of a difference. Also, the attachments for Invisalign aren't all the same on all teeth, some are square, some are tiangles, some are half-moons and you might even get two attachments on a single tooth. When it's that uneven, I'd say it can look worse than braces. Besides, we're in the middle of a pandemic so you can just wear a mask and cover it up.\\n\\nPlus, if you're worried about the pain, let me tell you that the first few days with a new aligner will hurt and it will hurt more every time you take them out and put them back in, so keep that in mind. Many people will extend their treatment time because they aren't wearing their trays as much as they should because it hurts so they don't want to wear them. Some people give up all together and stop wearing them. With braces it won't happen because you don't have a choice, since you can't remove them by yourself, so you'll be fine as long as you go to your appointments and don't break brackets. Then some people don't wear their aligners as much as they should because they are snacking all the time and you're not supposed to eat or drink anything except water while wearing them.\\n\\nAlso, while oral hygiene can be a hassle with braces because the brackets and wire are in the way and you have to keep all of that clean, with Invisalign comes the hassle of keeping your aligners clean and smelling fresh too, because smelly aligners can give you bad breath.\\n\\nIdk if something that's so high maintece and so much more expensive (in your case) is really worth it. But of course, whether or not it's worth it is up to you to decide. I never minded the look of braces anyway, so I might be biased.\\n\\nOf course, all of this doesn't mean I regret getting Invisalign. For me the cost for Invisalign wasn't that different from braces because my treatment with braces was longer, so in the end they came out about the same. Plus, it's a different experience with Invisalign and I'm happy about that.\\n\\nSorry for the essay.First of all, please dont apologize for that. Thank you so much for writing it, its some really good info on what you dont hear about Invisalign. Ill have to take some of your points into consideration. Again ty :)I think thats a reasonable price for Invisalign treatment. Do you have pics of at your teeth currently look like? Im beginning my Invisalign treatment soon and I put in $2k for down payment and will be paying $176 a month for 18 months for a total of $5k.Unfortunately we didnt get any of the pics they got. I was searching around and I say people say their Invisalign costed 5k+ so thats why I came here to get some opinions from the sub :)Oh okay! Both of my dentist and ortho quoted me $5k, but I think $5k was already a fixed cost for both Invisalign and braces that my dentist was offering to all her patients. Without a discount, my ortho quoted me $5750 total for Invisalign.Do they have dental insurance? Mine was a total of $5600 but my insurance paid $2500 so that brought the cost down considerably. I know not everyone has these benefits though.I got a 250 dollar discount because my sister got braces there and their insurance covered 1500 dollars.\\n\\nSo before those discounts, it was 5.8kJust keep emphasizing that you will cover the cost difference and you are aware of the responsibility. Unfortunately I cant think of anything else. \\n\\nI dont know what your teeth situation is but if it is something that you can live with for a while, you could always wait until you have more money and pay for the whole thing or are off of your parents insurance. I know it may be affecting your confidence daily so that may not be an option, but it sounds like traditional braces would also affect your confidence. \\n\\nMake sure you show you can handle the responsibility by showing your responsibility in other areas. Or set up a payment plan to pay them back the whole amount of you think that would help convince them. \\n\\nIm sorry you have to deal with this. I hope you can manage to convince them. Good luck!Well I was supposed to get braces 2 years ago but covid delayed us and my dad wants me to get them now so theyll be done during my senior year and before college.You could try the route of traditional braces being harder to keep clean with flossing and whatnot. I am very cavity-prone in those areas, so if I dont want to spend a bunch of money getting cavities filled, I needed to have Invisalign. If you end up having a bunch of cavities, that would actually bring the cost of traditional braces up if you include all the trips to the dentist. \\n\\nI have never had traditional braces but I heard that you had to visit the ortho more often in order to get them tightened/adjusted. In theory, you might not have to visit very often for Invisalign unless you lost a button/attachment or your teeth werent tracking. Might be worth asking the ortho if one or the other had more in-office visits. That could change their minds if they had to take off of work less to take you to the ortho. \\n\\nIn all honesty, if I were you, I would make up a big presentation on the advantages of Invisalign and also have a sheet showing the hidden costs of braces (cavity fillings, extra time off work, etc). Maybe that would show how much you really want this and how the cost difference isnt that large if you include the amount you are willing to put in and the hidden costs of braces.Substantially cheaper than what I had to pay. What matters most is what you can afford. Im very glad I went Invisalign but if the money will matter more to you, go regular braces to save yourself cash.\", 'labels': ['financial concerns', 'self-consciousness', 'facial appearance', 'oral hygiene', 'tray time management', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction'], 'scores': [0.2416919320821762, 0.15179844200611115, 0.15004652738571167, 0.12292683124542236, 0.12152719497680664, 0.12013115733861923, 0.09187792241573334]}, {'sequence': 'Should I go ahead with treatment?

So yes do it.Personally, I would just stay in the braces but Im a disgruntled Invisalign wearer for the last two years who probably has to go into bottom braces for at least 6 months starting in September \\n\\nBut yes, go for it!Have you had any more opinions from orthodontists? Why do you need the time in braces, instead of all 18 months in Invisalign?I believe it was to do with correcting the substantial overbite, I signed up for an invisalign course through my dentist and they said they weren\\'t able to offer me treatment and to seek specialist treatment. \\n\\nThe 6 months braces and 12 months invisalign timeframe was given to me by an orthodontist practice. Will have another appointment to discuss options so will ask about itSeek other specialist opinions.

When I asked the practice about it this is what they said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If you went for the Invisalign option you would need an upper removable appliance (plate) brace in the roof of your mouth first, and you would also have ceramic squares on the front 6 teeth at the same time as the plate “ this is to reduce your deep overbite first andÂ\\xa0also tidy up the upper front teeth first, then once this stage is finished we would take a new scan of the teeth to get your Invisalign aligners made to complete the treatment\"\\n\\nThanksIf youre already going through the process of getting regular braces, it just makes your live harder to basically start over and get used to Invisalign since its different. They both have their perks, but maybe start with the braces, and see how you feel. If you miss eating certain foods, or are really having a hard time cleaning your teeth properly, then switching to Invisalign may help.I would listen to the orthodontist, if they think that would work then go for it. Staying in braces is fine too but if youd rather have the Invisalign cause its more discrete (why I chose Invisalign) then deff do the switch! Its not that difficult to adapt to, the worst part is getting used to the pain of the first tray. But since you already had braces Id imagined youre mouth would be used to the pressure already. But its always good to have a second opinion> *Why would you recommend against a treatment of braces and invisalign?*\\n\\nAs /u/alexhimmi said, two treatment modalities are harder to get used to sequentially.\\n\\nThere are many ways of correcting your malocclusion, but I always apply the KISS rule.  Adults don\\'t do well with plates, and there are other techniques to achieve the same result without so much complexity.  Hence I would recommend seeking more consultations.Are they bringing your teeth/maxilla back?\\nAlways try to understand how a treatment will affect how your face/jaws will look and not just teeth alignment. Many times with braces, they bring teeth back to straighten and line up the bite, but this is at the expense of your facial profile. You want to make sure they are expanding you and bring both jaws forward, looks like your mandible is probably recessed. Hard to know with just pictures of teeth though. \\nNot all orthodontics keep this in mind unfortunately.Why braces first?It\\'s up to you but yes.', 'labels': ['facial appearance', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'self-consciousness', 'oral hygiene', 'tray time management', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'financial concerns'], 'scores': [0.22508276998996735, 0.17661678791046143, 0.1625996083021164, 0.13609559834003448, 0.12546531856060028, 0.10539852827787399, 0.06874144822359085]}, {'sequence': \"Hello people, finished my treatment 37 trays weekly changes, with some refinements.

My jaw is slanted in a similar way so my midline is also off and I dont care. It would require like 6 months more of treatment and I just cannot care enough. Im so happy with my results, and I think yours look great too!The midline isn't noticeable at all. I can tell you that because mine has been like this for the last 12 years, and no one has ever said anything about it. Even the orthodontists and dentists I've worked with haven't said anything about it.I never even noticed that my midline doesn't line up until I got Invisalign lol. Went back to photos from when I got my braces off as a teen and it didn't line up then either. I think it's pretty normal and no one notices. I'm not expecting mine to get close to lining up with Invisalign, my mouth shape just doesn't seem to allow it.I start to think it is impossible to reach perfection with Invisalign. Your teeth look good but if you allow me to be brutally honest, I can tell the bottom teeth are not perfect. I posted something similar today as I am having similar problems. I think Invisalign is good for fixing minor things, but not good if you wanna straighten your teeth properly. As I said in my post, I regret I preferred it over traditional braces. Im almost certain I will need to do fix braces after Invisalign to get the results I want.

Stay tuned!Looking forward to see your progress! Best of luck to you!Thats quite a journey! Good for you for taking the plunge!

The orthodontist was supportive of his desire to do aligners. I had traditional braces and hated them. I still have scars inside my mouth so since the ortho supported we went with it.As far as hygiene goes it's not especially difficult. He takes them out, eats, brushes his teeth and puts them back on. Putting them on without brushing is not a good idea and should be avoided as much as possible, otherwise he risks cavities. Flossing is very important, at least once a day before bed. A portable kit consisting of a brush and toothpaste and some floss is a must, as well as an aligner case to put them in when he's not wearing them.\\n\\nThat being said, he is only 12 years old and aligners might be a challenge for him. If you want to put anything but water in your mouth they should be taken out, and ideally you need to brush afterwards. Ideal daily wear is 20-22 hours, but wearing them less than 20 hours a day should be avoided as much as possible. Aligners take a lot of discipline even for adults, let alone a kid.\\n\\nGood luck!\\n\\nEdit to add: an ortho key is apparently a handy tool for taking them out, although I've never used it. There's also chewies which are bits of gum really that you chew on to seat the aligners, but I don't use those either. I don't find them to be essential. If I feel like I need to seat my aligners better I just bite on some cotton rounds a few times.Hi! Youve already gotten some good advice here but I wanted to jump on to offer encouragement. My 11 year old and 13 year old are both doing Invisalign right now. They are around the half way mark and weve had no issues. No problems getting them to wear them, no one has lost them or accidentally thrown them out and their orthodontist is very pleased with the progress. I found it next to impossible to find stories from other parents whos kids were doing Invisalign and a lot of comments saying it was a mistake not doing braces. It was initially discouraging but after the feedback from their ortho I know theyre doing great.\\n\\nWe get the kids to brush their teeth AND aligners every time they eat at home. If they are at school or a friends house, they are to rinse their mouth and the aligners with water. Once a week we use a retainer cleaning tab in an ultrasonic cleaner to get them nice and fresh again. \\n\\nAn ortho key was very helpful in the weeks following their attachments being put on.

I am just warning others of my experience and at the end of the day its their choiceYou can warn people about your experience without starting with œdont do this its awful\\x9d. I would be far more receptive to this post had you started with something closer to œI had a bad experience and would like to share with others\\x9d. This post isnt warning or sharing, its fear mongering. And I dont think its fair to make blanket statements saying that its great and works for everyone either. Neither are adding anything to the conversation.I probably should have worded it better, but I was just feeling really down from it, and wish I had opted for braces, sorry for being kinda bratty, but the mixture of the three (and finals lmao) got the better of me[removed]/r/Invisalign Is a friendly, inclusive community and does not condone profanity or disrespect of any kind.\\n    \\n\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Idk ·You are most likely a borerline surgical open bite. You wouldnt be able to tell from just those photos but your comments from the ortho give credence to this.  \\n\\nIf you go to an experienced invisalign ortho they would tell you they prefer to treat this type of case with aligners over braces due to the biomechanics involved.  The comprimise if any would be if your passed on the surgery.  But the ortho part can and probably should be treated with aligners.   Get a second opinion and pick someone experienced with Invisalign.Ya you\\'re probably right. So basically what you\\'re saying is it  just depends what the Ortho is good at? Or do you really think invis would do a better job at treating my case? \\n\\n I\\'m going to schedule an appt with a \"diamond pro\" individual I found off Invisalign site. They should be able to help alsoYes exactly. Aligners and braces are two different modalities.   They work differently to move teeth.  Both are extremely technique sensitive.  So treatment plan recommendations\\nwill be based on doctor experience and comfort.  Which is why you will get a variety of opinions on this.  \\n\\nAn experienced Ortho that treats with invisalign will understand how to use aligner strenghts to treat your type of case.  If you are truly an open bite that is borderline surgical, there is evidence based literature that support Aligner usage in these type of situations. Not only with closing  the open bite but also long term stability compared to braces.  There are numerous articles in the journals of cases just like yours . I wouldnt be surprised if you get the opposite recommendation ( that they prefer invisalign over braces ) for the above reasons.  \\n\\nYour next step is wise.  Just make sure it is an ortho and not a GP.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind. Photos are just photos.  Doctors use xrays and in mouth observation to diagnosis.  There may be more to your story but like i said your comments from the ortho and your Gp give credence to the fact that you have an openbite that is borderline surgical which means there is a skeletal component.  A treament plan that will mask the skeletal the best they can is what they are aiming for.Thank you \\x8fOrtho said no liners due to minor open bite.. should I go to someone else?

He said \"we can\\'t to 100 percent, but we can get closer to it using braces than Invisalign\" and maybe he\\'s got a pointthank you and its okay i think itll go away overtime! but yeah i def think ur ortho has  a point just because with braces i feel like your jaw would be more relaxed bc u dont have plastic trays in ur mouth. and with invisaligns youre constantly taking them out to eat and drink vs braces your teeth are just always moving. just do ur research and u should be okay!! good luck with whatever you choose :)Baloney. Onto the next orthodontic consultation. Third time hopefully the charm. Your preference on Invisalign vs braces is one of the most important parts of your treatment plan. Sure its the doctors job and due diligence to let you know what his opinion is on which treatment method hed deem most successful but Ive seen miraculous work done with clear aligners and its surprising he told you youre not a good candidate IMO. Obviously not everyone can have success with Invisalign, but Ive seen wack teeth (I work for a dentist) get turned way around with Invisalign. Dont give up :)Get a 2nd opinionI was told braces would get me a better result too. I chose Invisalign as I didnt want regular braces. My treatment will be 18 months, Im 5 months in.

That's definitely a question for an orthodontist and not just someone who spends too much time on this subreddit.I'm not a dentist, but am due to get an implant myself and have had extensive discussions with my ortho about it. You need a certain amount of bone to do an implant. If there's not enough to move a tooth I to, there's probably not enough to do an implant, and whatever the underlying cause of the gum recession is would be a concern for an implant too.\\n\\nI think you're right, OP needs to ask their ortho.

Can my mates stop with the dislikes, were having a conversation here, thanks!It's not something I'm seeing from the picture, it's from what you said in an earlier comment - you said your dentist told you there wasn't enough bone to move the tooth. All I'm saying is that if there's not enough bone to move it, there's not enough for an implant.\\n\\nTbh your questions really need a professional to answer, none of us online are qualified to give medical advice on your specific caseyes, it was her saying it, i cant say either\\n\\nI simply dont understand how can you tell by looking at it, without an X-ray but she prolly knows what she's doing\\n\\nThe question is, will the discomfort subside if I do gum grafting so the tooth wont be out in the open?Just go with a general dentist. That also can be damage due of brushing to hard. Go to a general dentist!!!Hi! Dentist here (I specialized in ortho), you will always need a gum graft. Braces would make it easier to set the graft. \\nWhat you have to understand is, that the recession comes from a loss of bone on the bukkal side of the tooth. Changing the position of the tooth won't bring the bone back. That's why you will always need a gum graft. Since the bone will unlikely regrow, you maybe have to redo the graft after a couple of years. (Sorry for bad English, not my first language :)Question from an idiot ‹\\x8d‚ï¸\\x8f Would it be easier to just take that tooth out and put in a fake tooth implant?Another idiot here with the same question\\x9dHaha that is not an idiot question! I heard that one on a conference! And no, still the same problem - no bone on the bukkal side, so the gum will probably recede again. No way around the graft :)Maybe you should see a gum specialist/periodontist? They might have options, like a gum graft.  That may help with the appearance and possibly the irritation. I dont know if that will change whether or not orthodontics is an option, but If that is gum recession what ever is causing it should be explored before it progresses. Did the orthodontist suggest that you visit a periodontist?its been like that ever since my braces 10 years ago got taken off, that canine were very high up and it ruined the gums, not really bothering, its morely the tooth itself being closer to my lips than it is on the other side and sometimes drives me crazyI had gum recession on one of my lower teeth due the permanent retainer bar essentially starting to unwind and strain that tooth (dentist kept saying i was brushing too hard before I finally went into an ortho). I had a gum graft in dec 2020 ($5000 dollars before benefits), after it healed (amazing and worth it but fuck..), I started Invisalign. Braces causes trauma to our teeth which can result in gum recession especially if the movements are large (all things Ive learned).\\n\\nThe first ortho I went to wanted me to do the graft after we moved the teeth (and suggested reg braces which would have caused more trauma), second ortho was 3 grand cheaper, offered payment plans, wanted the graft first, and suggested mild adjustments via a long Invisalign program to fix. Definitely worth a second opinion from an ortho (not Redditorthos).after the gum graft surgery was the healing very bad, like super painful in the first days weeks?Not going to lie to you, it wasnt a great time. The graft itself did not bother me, it was the œharvest area\\x9d (ewww). Had a hole in the roof of my mouth that food could literally go in and I would have to swish out. Mouths heal quickly thank goodness but I was on soft food for a while. Premade some soups and stocked up on pudding etc. I was getting sensitivity on that tooth and it was uncomfortable- I do not regret it.  I would plan to take a few days off work to sleep and be a whiney blanket burritoThought it wasnt going to be pleasurable\\n\\nIs there any reason why you got the gum graft before getting Invisalign? ( since gum graft gives no additional benefit for how strongly the tooth is fitting in its place )\\n\\nAfter Invisalign the gum will be receding a little again I guess?Yeah theres no way they can move that tooth without the risk of it falling out. You have an EXTREME amount of gum and bone loss there. You need to see a periodontist for sure.I understand the gum loss seeing the image but how do you tell theres any less bone than its supposed to be?Dude you can literally see the root of your tooth. Thats not normal or healthy.no its not, but how do you tell that there is less bone than there is supposed to be when its the gum that receded?Because the root of your tooth is covered by bone (in a socket) and well, its not. cause we can see it when we shouldnt be able to. That tooth is in bad condition dude. Just go see a specialist and stop arguing about it with people when you asked them their opinion in the first place.Ok\\n\\nNot arguing just curious, I'm going my mateYou need a gum graft, I got one on one of my canines as wellVisit a periodontist, an orthodontist isnt the right speciality for this.The tooth itself is not badly positioned.  It's your gum that's gone.  You need a gum graft.\\n\\nEDIT: It's also possibly not held solidly in the bone.  Without the xray it's hard to tell.  Some teeth have very long root.  Your dentist will know.  If that's the case, you cannot move it, either with braces or clear aligners.  It would pop out of your jaw and you would lose it.is that why I have this feeling of it being a separate from the rest of my teeth? Appearance wise its not but in term of how it feels its cumbersome AFIt probably requires more maintece than your other teeth.  Have it fixed as soon as possible.The canines on the left ( my right) according to the doc are in the right position and it's the other one that should be fixed which I don t care about at all \\n\\nThe problem is though it annoys my lips from the inside, like really irritating sometimes, what should I do?I would ask about a gum graft for that recession. Also definitely x-rays because that tooth color is concerning.the color is not bad though in real life, maybe its the image\\n\\nthought about gum grafting not sure if it'd be useful though for other than aesthetic reasons, dont care enough about its appearance rather than the teeth being to close to my lips to the point it being really annoying sometimesWith recession that pronounced you may start to experience nerve pain.  You should see a periodontist to discuss how serious it is because gum disease is a very important contributor to overall health.I'm just in shock that your dentist didn't send you to a periodontist years ago. Fire your dentist.I agree with some of the others. You have bad gum recession in general and it's severe at that particular tooth. Work on flossing and general oral hygiene for a while before consulting with another orthodontist because your teeth are generally pretty straight.Its like this ever since my braces got taken off 8 years ago at age 19,   \\nLike the braces have moved the teeth around and got the gums a little messed up and since then I dont think it receded a lot if any  \\n\\n\\nThe rest of the teeth look like this, on the right\\n\\n[http://www.youngsdentalpractice.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gums.jpg](http://www.youngsdentalpractice.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Gums.jpg)\\n\\n does it seem like receding?Mentioned this elsewhere but shifting our teeth causes them to move in gums which can lead to recession. Gum graft is totally worth it (and will protect the root of that tooth). I wouldnt be surprised if a lot of the discomfort you described is reduced by the graft alone. If you have an ortho they can refer you to a periodontist or just call one up for an assessment.I'm heading for an periodontist asap thanks for the helpMind you Im from Canada so it might work a bit different in other countries (and hopefully cost less)Disclaimer- I am not a dentist. Just a worry wart that does a LOT of research on just about anything, and have a friend who has gone through something similar. You may need a bone graft for that area in the future. I would highly suggest speaking with your dr about getting referred to an oral surgeon sooner rather than later. Youll most likely need a gum graft regardless, but if you ever want to fix the discomfort, you may need to get it pulled and the actual jaw fixed/built up first and then maybe consider an implant. You might be a really good candidate for university programs that do dental cheaper as students practice for their practicums, etc,  under direct supervision. The can do work for like up to 60% cheaper. Maybe an option? Regardless, Id see a periodontist as soon as possible before even considering ortho work. Youll be much more comfortable with the periodontist assisting you as this is what they do really well.I'm going to a periodontist asap but in the meanwhile what do you mean by having to have the jaw fixed up?\\n\\nHow do you tell there is anything wrong with the jaw other than the gum receding on the canine?What I mean by that is, in order to have your teeth moved, you will have to have some sort of work done to the jaw in the area where your canine is, whether that be a pulled tooth, an implant further in, a bone graft, a gum graft, etc or your option for moving teeth might be off the table as that tooth is very close to the edge and you may lose it. What I meant by œfix/build it up\\x9d in the context, was that if you are considering an implant, theyll pull that tooth, then youll have a hole in your bone where that tooth lived, so if they try to put an implant in with a thin wall next to it because of your previous tooths home, it may fail down the line. So theyd probably want to build up the area around the pulled tooth before being able to proceed with the implant option. Regardless, like I said, Im not a dentist. I simply have a friend who has gone through something similar.Not a dentist but maybe you could get a dental implant.

Ask your dentist whos experience in these matters exceeds the people in this sub Reddit who are only experiencing one side of the process and know nothing about the biomechanics of tooth movement.I already did, just looking for some opinions!And what did your treating clinician say to explain the appearance of the clinicheck?I wouldn't be happy with that.Sorry but what the fuck? No work on the bite at all it seems.This is going to require many many refinements. Your first set here is just about getting everything in position since teeth straightening and bite correction are an incredibly complicated and delicate dance. I find it hard to believe that it wasnt communicated to you that this was one phase of a multiphase process, but the term refinement is also misleading. It suggests small additional changes after treatment when in reality, refinements for some can be an entire second phase of treatment. \\n\\nIn your case, traditional braces probably would have been faster and easier (relatively speaking) in terms of fixing your bite.Yea I was thinking the same thing. If I had known this I would've chosen the traditional ones60 trays, weekly changes. In week 2 now. My upper front teeth aren't center now and they look even further away in 60 weeks. Also get a weird new gap on the side. The overbite seems worse as well.Is this 60, then refinements? I just finished 8mo and was scanned for another 20 weeks (so 14mo total) and at refinements my teeth needed another IPR and a tooth wasnt tracking at all. I was told refinements were at 60% of my treatment. So this may only be a midpoint for your treatment.I would really discuss the expected results and see if anything can be done, normally you should do this before you start with your first tray but better sooner than later. If you dont get a satisfying result I would recommend seeing another dentist for the treatment.\\n\\nIts not uncommon though for things to get worse before they get better, often some teeth need to move away before they can get into the right spot.Whyd you approve thisI wonder if you are a candidate for orthognathic (jaw correction) surgery.Yeah I got recommended to do this, but the rules in my country just changed so my insurance won't cover it and it's gonna cost 6k-8k. They're only covering it when it is already damaging my teeth which is only a matter of time according to my ortho :/They changed the rules? I saw in your comment youre from NL, could you point me in the direction of where i can find this info? I have jaw surgery planned in 2022/2023 after invisalign, but definitely cant afford without insuranceThis is what my ortho and oral surgeon (kaakchirurg) told me. It's only possible in 'zeer ernstige' cases. My ortho send in a request for the surgery but it got denied by my insurance. My ortho told me if it got accepted I wouldn't be able to get Invisalign tho, since insurance doesn't cover thatThats odd, mine said they only do the surgery if its covered , but they often combine surgery and invisalign. (I did pay for invisalign) I suppose i will have to finish this round before i get information on the surgery.. \\n\\nMaybe it also depends on which insurance company you have?How do you get your plan on the app?I'm not sure actually, it was just there. Maybe contact your dentist?Saw that you might need an email from them in another thread. Thanks though!I asked my ortho and she had to agree to share the info in their app. I saw her do this when I asked. Just give your ortho a call!https://www.devonsquareorthodontics.com/upload/invisalign-app.pdf\\n\\nHope this helpsLooks like mine uhhhhAbsolutely not!  So I have switched to braces for this exact problem.  My bite wasnt nearly as deep as it is now and I addressed the issue with my ortho.  Be. said that it is unlikely invisalign can fix it and will need braces in the end.  I switched to top braces for not to fix the bite a little bit before switching the bottom as well.Ugh. Ive been wanting to get braces to not only secure my teeth better but help with my bite since bands with Invisalign didnt help well, my only issue is I dont want to pay for it all over again, and then I had to move almost across the country so Im feeling really annoyed about it. My ortho also never told me my teeth were damaged from grinding them and thats why my teeth dont look perfectly straight, he actually got pissed and me and was offended that I pointed it out thinking it was just a little crooked. He then told me he refuses to grind any teeth down to just make it even so I can have an even bite. I cant stand how they just ask you if your bite feels right or feel even, I dont fckin know, idk how its supposed to feel. Now Im stuck with an uneven bite and my teeth moving everyday because Invisalign sucks. I regret getting it \\xad\\xadSo sorry to hear about your experience. Im going to @you in a different thread about getting help from Invisalign.\\n\\nEdit: I tried, let me know if it worked. Im a noobare you not going to get bonding treatments?It gets your teeth in alignment. I would also consider veneers. I say this as someone who did Invisalign, an implant, and veneers on my top teeth. Expensive, but no regrets.[deleted]Swipe right buddyI see, thanks.Dude now way ‚I don't think you will be done after 60 trays, but you should ask for more info. If your bite is really something which is physically hurting you, like grinding down your front teeth AND getting your gums inflamed, you can get a big part reimbursed from the Mutualiteit, if the ortho deems it necessary for you to get braces. NL of BE?NL, so I guess the Mutualiteit isn't for meHell noI dont think Invisalign is the right route for you to take.

I have 36 weekly tray changes and had braces as a kid, so we are not adjusting my bite but just fixing turned teeth (including incisors) that moved when i stupidly stopped wearing my retainer. So those with more complicated plans may have a different experience. \\n\\nTHAT BEING SAID, this subreddit had me SO SCARED and even had me delaying my Invisalign start for a year. This subreddit is filled with horror stories, complaints and stuff thatll make you go insane with fear. Im on tray 34 of 36 and it certainly isnt a pleasure to wear trays everyday, it is at worst a minor inconvenience. \\n\\n1). Pain- I change trays weekly and do it always at night. I LOOK FORWARD to œnew tray day\\x9d because the discomfort (wouldnt even call it pain) reminds me that things are moving!  After even night one, the discomfort is markedly better. Never have even taken pain killers except week one where it admittedly was hard to get used to. But were talking just one week. After that no real problems and smooth sailing. Im prone to cankers generally but havent had one this whole time (even with 6 buttons). \\n\\n2). Hygiene- Im admittedly not the best here, but thats the point. People get WAY too pressed about it. I brush my teeth every time I can after every meal. Rarely floss if ever (should be doing that anyway, I know). If Im out to dinner, I usually just pop them back in after with just a swig of water, knowing Ill brush my teeth as soon as I get home. Its truly not that serious and as crazy as some people make it out to be. Sure, brushing and flossing every single time would be great, but if youre worried that its absolutely required, take it from me”you can do your best and be fine. \\n\\n3). Tray Time- just wear them when youre not eating. I dont track tray time. There are days where I wear them less because I got caught on a call after lunch. Its fine. Never has been an issue. Trays have tracked every week. Just wear them!  Its really not a big deal. \\n\\n4). People Noticing- most people dont notice (Ive literally asked if they can tell). Sometimes I can hear a slight lisp but the real lisp that anyone else can hear goes away in like a day after starting. Its so insignificant and just a reminder of you actively doing something to better yourself everyday. \\n\\nTLDR: Dont listen to all the people on here. This subreddit attracts people who are having trouble, and while it can be helpful, Ive found it more scary than anything after having my experience. No regrets except worrying so much about it and waiting so long to do it!  Happy to answer any questions but go do it!!As a patient with a complicated plan ill weigh in since your post is for simple treatment and having both in one place might be helpful to those somewhere in the middle of us. I had no braces as a kid, a crossbite, and crowding to the point of having what some have commented as [shark teeth](https://old.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/ubro91/3939_bottom_3948_top_so_crazy_what_invisalign_can/) - visually it looked like i had 2 sets of teeth. I had extractions, buttons on every tooth except one molar, and 48 trays.\\n\\n1). Pain- I did have pain. Quite a bit some weeks. I change my trays in the morning after following tis subs advice about changing them at night to begin with, except i *could not sleep* at ALL with the pain. I started switching in the morning and taking paracetamol on the weeks it hurt bad. I chose liquid 'childs' paracetamol (tylenol for you US folks), and it kicked it right away. No more pain. It worked for me so thats what i did. Some weeks the pain was intolerable until i took painkillers, others i barely noticed. I too liked tray change day, because it felt like movement was happening and thats what we all hope for here. \\n\\n2). Hygiene- I do brush and floss **every time** my trays come out. Every single time. I am cursed not only with crooked teeth, but genetics decided to go the extra mile and give me thin enamel. I have suffered horribly in my life with cavities and that was PRE-Invisalign. I once had needed a root canal because of a dental infection that got so bad it spread to my jaw and trust me i do not say this lightly - it nearly killed me. I was in A&E, on *morphine* which did not even touch the pain, waiting for emergency surgery to get my tooth pulled and the infection drained from my jaw. Which i did by the way, a bottom front tooth. So no i dont mess around with hygiene. If you are not as cursed as me, you will probably be fine.. but thats a choice you have to make yourself.\\n\\n3). Tray Time- Wear them when youre not eating i agree. I did track my tray time for the first few months, to make sure i was accurately reading time. Its very easy to think 'oh they were only out for 30 minutes, when in fact it had been 45.  I do OMAD so, its easy for me to know my trays are in for 23 hours a day. My ortho told me in the beginning when discussing wear time: If theyre not in, theyre not working. That stuck with me, so yeah.. just wear them. \\n\\n4). People Noticing- Literally no one notices lol Even on my messed up, grown in everywhere teeth that people **stare** at, with attachments on every tooth, some big ones.. people didnt notice. We stare at our own faces every day so of course YOU notice them, but i guarantee you if they didnt notice them on me, they arent gonna notice them on you. \\n\\nI wasnt stressed about Invisalign, or braces, because i had wanted them **my entire life**. I knew there could be pain, i knew there could be discomfort. I knew my life would invariably have to change a little to accommodate them. And yet despite our differences in experience, **i agree with OP.** \\n\\nJust do it. 1 year from now if you do nothing your teeth are going to be exactly the same, except you'll be 1 year older. Time will continue to pass whether you get this done or not. There will be people who could be given 3 wishes for ANYTHING they want in life and will find some reason to be unhappy about it. Invisalign has an unquestionable positive impact on the majority of people who go through it. We are the many, not the few. \\n\\nDont let the few change your mind about it.From someone who also has pretty messed up teeth and never had braces as a kid:\\n\\nThe pain is, I think, worse for us because there's so much more movement going on. Rotating a tooth 2 degrees is going to be much easier than moving a tooth horizontally a full centimeter.\\n\\nHygiene is super important to me too, since I also have thin enamel. I also have had a shit ton of cavities. One was under a molar sealant, so it went completely undetected until it hit the root of the tooth. Thankfully it didn't get to the jaw bone, but my tooth also had to be pulled.\\n\\nI think it's much easier for people like us to make the decision to get Invisalign because it's pretty much a no brainer. For people with teeth that are just slightly misaligned, I'd honestly recommend not doing it. It's a super unpopular opinion here for obvious reasons, but if your bite is fine and all you're trying to do is adjust one very mildly wayward tooth, I don't think the high price and hassle is worth it. There are obviously cases somewhere between those two extremes, and that's where I think people can use this info for deciding if it's worth it.My opinion is the opposite. If you can afford it, its totally worth it and not a big hassle. But to each their own!I legit just popped in my second trey going to bed soon. Not bad at all. Idk how to describe it but I get a ticklish sensation in my gums with pressure feeling on teeth. People on here had me scared but it has been a breeze thus far.I'm starting in a month and needed to read this. Thank you!!Dont fret!  On day 2 I was like œcan I really do this?\\x9d And after that I havent sweated it once. The people on this subreddit mean well but are not representative of the typical experience!  Been wanting to write this for months but waiting until the œend\\x9d of my experience to do so to make sure I wasnt missing something. \\n\\nAgain, this is just my experience so Im sure it can differ but felt it was important to share!It's definitely important! As with reviews, people are more likely to share bad / negative experiences. Which is understandable. I literally saved your post so I can go back to it whenever I start to feel anxious, haha.

Maybe the friend with perfect teeth knew they had that edge on you, but are sad to be presumably losing it.  Maybe the poor teeth friend sees you improving and now feels like, œDamn, I have to get Invisalign now\\x9d. \\nMaybe the means arent in place to proceed or they have to confront their dentistry fears or who knows?

They wouldn\\'t function as teeth and I\\'d likely need dentures relatively young. So yeah, I want them to look nice as we all do but mostly the other part.i literally learned to use photoshop because i hated how my teeth looked in PHOTOS, where i was able to pose to make them look better than they did in real life. whatever they say, the outcome of your decision & your contentment with it is what matters!!I feel you on this. Even my own husband made comments about how he didnt even notice my teeth. I noticed them. I hated them. And I am so glad I started treatment. Its all about doing things that make you happy.I\\'ve never really thought much about it. Whenever I tell someone I have invisalign and they\\'re shocked, it just reinforces the idea that people really do not pay nearly as much attention as we think they do and all that anxiety is for naught.Stop worrying so much about what everyone else has to say about you and you will live a happier , better and less stressful lifeAlso, sometimes people do invisalign for reasons other than looks. Sometimes there are functional issues from the misalignment that aren\\'t outwardly apparent.I agree on this. I hate that people assume I dont need invisalign . But inside it bothers me so much.Most people dont see our imperfections the way we see them. When we look in the mirror we see what is wrong with us, the rest dont focus on this. I dont believe most people say comments like this to be mean or rude or even disrespectful.Yep! My front top teeth dont look bad when you look straight at me. When I smile, my bottom lip doesnt move down and thats where the majority of issues are. Growing up we didnt have money for braces and my parents have told me they (still) feel bad they couldnt get them for me. Theres so much more wrapped up in all of it than a lot of people realize.All of my crowded/crooked teeth are hidden by top teeth when I smile so I get this a lot. What they don\\'t see is that my bottom teeth are raised and bite into my palate. It has been extremely painful for me growing up and has caused many problems. If it were just for purely cosmetic reasons, I would never have gotten invisalign. However, the pain relief that I\\'ve already received having just started my treatment makes all of those comments pointless to me. In the end, we are doing invisalign for ourselves and we all have our own reasons. It is irrelevant if others believe that we need it or not.I got that alot too! I was like, well I noticed lol I have braces not invisilign but my bite feels sooo much more comfortable after wearing them a yearI get super annoyed that 9/10 times people make some sort of comment like this to me once they see I have Invisalign (I have attachments on basically every tooth, some two).\\n\\nNow I don\\'t say anyrhing.

So 3 months ago I went in for an Invisalign consult. They told me Id be a great fit for Invisalign and quoted me $6700 for 18 months of treatment. The catch is they would need me on 3-4 months of braces to fix two rotated teeth on the upper row. I bit the bullet and said yes to both. They put the upper braces on and flash forward to Monday, they put braces on the lower row. They said not quite enough space was made for the rotation and theyd need me to keep the braces on until June of next year. Thats almost 3 times as long as they said and I almost feel like they pulled a bait-and-switch on me by collecting fees for Invisalign but giving me braces. Save for the tooth rotation, the upper row almost seems like its completely aligned. They also said my lower row was very very slightly out of alignment and should be fixed quickly on Invisalign before they proceeded to go ahead and put braces on them. Is this normal/heard of in this industry or should I confront them about this?I don't think it's bad to ask questions and get some explanation but they're the experts.

I have OCD. I told him my reality is that I do fixate on my teeth.

I think that\\'s the first thing I\\'d do in your situation. Good luck.Would that cost more?I mean it really depends. If it\\'s in the same practice it might not (but I wouldn\\'t recommend that), if you book an appointment with a different orthodontist it depends on what they charge for appointments. If you\\'re genuinely convinced that your dr is being scummy, would the extra cost really be too much for you? You\\'re honestly putting a price on your own comfort of knowing. Good luckYep, on refinement #6 and get 8 trays each time! I am on clincheck #3 because I refuse to do another refinement! They keep saying, we can fix the rest with bonding, bonding tho WHO is going to pay for because I paid for Invisalign! I feel like each set has been rushed and there was not any care put into any of it! If I can go back and chose a different dentist I would!I get that! I asked about potentially needing bonding and he said \"if we can\\'t get the gap to close, yes.\" Like what? That was my main concern here!!The fact that he was so insensitive to your OCD regarding your teeth and the appearance of them is mind blowing to me. Im glad he didnt end up teaching at the œprestigious private school\\x9d because he seems to lack empathy for people suffering from mental health disorders- the number one thing any good teacher should have.

I guess he teaches one day a week there, but he made it sound like they want him to teach more....Yikes Im so sorry you have to deal with him. Deff shop around.

They make too much money to give such bad service! Continue until you get the results you want. \\x9dï¸\\x8fThank you.I\\'ve had a similar experience. Out of curiosity, What is your age and if you could estimate the age of the orthodontist? I actually have a theory60 or older. I\\'d love to hear it! Yes. makes total sense.  are you a millennial by chance ? or have a millennial mindset? \\n\\nThis doctor is a boomer and to add to it he is a trained clinician boomer. Basically in his mind he wants to tell you what is ideal and what is important because he  is the clinician . It is how that generation is wired.  People with a millennial mindset want to tell doctors what is important to them and what they want done etc.  \\n\\nThere have been whole books written on this.  These types of doctors tend to struggle and get frustrated with millennial patients as a result . They should listen and try to achieve these results unless it would do harm. They should know if no harm would be done ( situation isnt worse as a result ) but it is more complicated of a treatment plan then they can charge accordingly.   \\n\\nInstead they try to convince you that you are a nut job and dont know what you talking about . They act annoyed.   Just like your post explained in detail.  \\n\\nmy experience which was similar to yours ( although of course i knew my theory and wanted to test it ).\\n\\nAfter mutiple times of the doctor making me feel\\nlike an idiot.  I just said\\n\\n\" Doc, I appreciate everything you have done. I chose to be treated by you for your expertise and experience. Your input is invaluable to me.  May I ask you,  if  we changed the angulation( wasnt happy with how one tooth was angled )  of this tooth I am not happy with, would it actually do me harm? Or do you just disagree with me on what looks good vs not ?\"\\n\\nHe actually agreed it was the the disagreement.

He acts like Im being picky, but this is a huge investment.I get that! Also, mine won\\'t do ipr and doesn\\'t want to correct my midline for fear of making it worse!its absolutely a huge investment and you deserve to be happy with the end result. if you have the comprehensive plan, which it sounds like you do, the refinements should be included until you are pleased, within 5 yearsSo you stated you have OCD, so my guess is that your orthodontist is probably right.

Sounds a lot more convenient than the one you have to put on each night after you finish the treatmentSo I actually still have the full plastic retainer to wear at night. And just FYI, you will probably wear it full time for a couple months before you go to just nightly.  The permanent retainer is a piece of wire that is bonded to my bottom six teeth. You can google bonded retainers.  I just figured if I do ever slack on wearing my retainer, those bottom ones are the most likely to shift so I wanted the extra layer of protection.  The downsize is flossing with it is a pain.First off your smile is beautiful \\x8d Hoping I can pick your brain! My ortho is confident I will see the same results with Invisalign as traditional (ceramic) he doesnt upcharge for any option its all the same price, so that is not a factor. My only concern with doing Invisalign is the confidence in keeping them in when theyre hurting. Do you think you struggled with that? If you could do it all over would you still go with Invisalign? Any pros and cons you could give? Thank you in advance. \\x81\\n\\nEdit for misspellingSo I originally went in wanting to ceramic braces because I had been told in the past that I wouldnt qualify for Invisalign. My ortho only charged a few hundred more for Invisalign and told me I would actually be a good candidate.   I ending up going with Invisalign because 1. I didnt want to be in my late 20s and have braces. 2. I travel a lot for work and not being able to make regular appointments to tighten my braces would make my treatment longer and 3. Its much easier to floss and clean with Invisalign vs braces. I would absolutely do it over again if I could. The only time I had slight regret was when I had trouble learning how to take my trays out (the first couple days), but it gets easier and then isnt an issue at all.   \\nI would have slight soreness, but if I changed to a new tray before bed, it wasnt really an issue.  I would imagine that the metal pieces inside your mouth would be much more uncomfortable and that would be in additional to any teeth soreness.How much do they cost in total?I think I paid about $3500.  I know they gave me a small discount (like 5%) for paying all cash upfront.Great to know. Invisalign Lite right?No, I believe I had the comprehensive one. I chose to not do a second set of refinements because I was happy with my smile (and ready to be done) but it wouldnt have cost extra for me to do another round.Yes your teeth now is perfect!\\n\\nMy teeth right now is like your 'before' picture but maybe slightly better and it gave me confidence that it can look like your 'after' pictureHow did your teeth get so white?   I have impeccable oral hygiene and I see an increase in staining that I never had before.Bloody fucking hellWow amazing transformation!If you dont mind me asking, how much did it cost in total?I think I paid about $3500.  I know they gave me a small discount (like 5%) for paying all cash upfront.My bottom teeth are very similar to yours, I just started this past Wednesday, with 4 different sets to change out every 7 days. Seeing this affirms why Im doing this, youre looking great! Enjoy your new smile!They look amazing, great results! Can I ask how strict you were about how long you kept them in? Did you stick to 22 hours per day?For the first half of my treatment, I was very strict. I had the TrayMinder app and used the timer to ensure I hit the 22 hours. Ill be honest, I got more lazy as I got to the end, especially with my refinement trays where I was wearing them around 17-18 hours a day. However, if they ever started to feel tight when I would make sure to start wearing them longer again.  Obviously I dont recommend not being diligent about wear though. Being strict in the very beginning and having my teeth track well meant that my ortho allowed me to switch to quicker tray changes (moving from 14 to 10 and ultimately 7 days) which meant a shorter treatment time overall.\", 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'facial appearance', 'oral hygiene', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'tray time management', 'financial concerns', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns'], 'scores': [0.2426433563232422, 0.18367639183998108, 0.15093328058719635, 0.11801378428936005, 0.11492996662855148, 0.10989439487457275, 0.07990885525941849]}, {'sequence': 'Just received my first set of aligners from diamond braces!Two questions:\\n\\nI noticed that a bit of the glue from the attachments is still on one of my front teeth.

Orthodontist came in for actually 5 minutes or less and didn\\'t even look into my mouth even though I have a little more complex case. Third one which is the one I went with was wonderful. I looked up them up on the invisalign website which I highly recommend. It tells you how many cases each dentist and ortho has seen, what kind of extra services they provide, and a lot of great information. They are top 1% in the country apparently and have done a lot of cases. They did my diagnostic imaging first and then the orthodontist did an exam, we sat down at a table together and we went over all the things she was seeing on my teeth. She voluntarily contacted my oral surgeon who did my wisdom teeth removal because I plan on getting implants with them after invisalign and wanted to make sure she had all the ducks in a row. The day of getting my trays she gave me a great pep talk and had the person who put my attachments on take the time to show me how to put trays in and out and went over absolutely everything. The price is more than the 5k, actually 7.5k but I live in the Chicagoland area and its expensive here. I also don\\'t have dental insurance. They offered a payment plan with no interest so I\\'m just going with that. Hope that helps! Definitely recommend shopping around because it doesn\\'t hurt if they are not charging you for any diagnostic imaging.Thanks for all that. 3 weeks ago I didnt even know I needed/wanted Invisalign but now Im looking into it. My dentist did a scan that I had no idea was leading into a consultation. Its a lot to processI already had a family orthodontist so I knew her work was exceptional and she is very experienced.

Those are my biggest concern tbhIt the canines are whats bothering you, def get them contoured and see how it looks before paying for more treatment.\\n\\nOne thing my ortho explained is that due to root placement / shape of the teeth, the edges of my two front teeth would never line up perfectly. so I had them filed at the end of treatment - came out perfectly.That\\'s a good idea, I think I\\'ll give it a try. Thank you\\nDo you have any cons on the teeth filing?Do you think this is a decent result.

Were you satisfied with your ClinCheck?You would have to pay that money on top of the $$ you already spent on Invisalign treatment??? No way stick with your current ortho and as part of your Invisalign package you can request more trays if youre not happy - also can get composite bonding done to change the shape of your teethI personally think they are good and I would be happy with that smile, but its not about getting the perfect smile its about getting self confidence in your own smile so really only you can answer if youre happy with it or want to continue with more treatmentI paid for additional treatment,  and am afraid that if I request more treatment I would Have to pay againI would ask to intrude longer lateral incisor and extrude shorter one so that they are of equal length. Edit, after more careful observing I concluded they are the same length, that are central incisors that are tilted. Hard to believe Invisalign can\\'t make them all more parallel. Is middle picture \"before\" mirror image of after? Central incisors are tilted to opposite direction so I believe it is mirror image? Yes it is a big movement of roots but seen bigger on this sub. Maybe to find 3rd opinion. Those are really small nuances, your teeth have really nice shape.Middle picture is mirrored yes. The afters are not mirrored. Do you suggest I start the new treatment or I ask for more treatment time with invisalign?I would ask refinements to make central incisors parallel and of equal length, before any other things being done, maybe that will not be needed any more. I suppose refinements are included in your plan? It is significantly better so they just need to finish what they started.It appears to me that your entire upper set of teeth are slanted! Look at your midline in comparison to your upper lip. I would NOT accept this as a final result and would demand they finish out your treatment.This isnt something fixed by orthodontist work, its fixed by a surgeonIm sure the ortho would laugh if you went in and demanded this be fixed by invisilign.How is straightening the midline and adjusting tooth position NOT an orthodontists job? I dont see a jaw issue here at all.Its the position of her upper jaw, not necessarily the position of the teeth that are making them slantedThen why is there no jaw misalignment in the œbefore\\x9d photo?I had a VERY  similar slanted issue with my teeth and Invisalign has fixed it, so. Idk. Im not sure I see what youre seeing in this pic. Can you explain which area(s) make you think jaw alignment vs tooth alignment?I feel like the pic I posted is misleading and not straight angle, fron what I am realizing now. I\\'ll work on posting a better onePosted a new post, please check. what do you think?Central incisors are not perpendicular to the lips (and to the jaw, it seems); they are slanted.  \\nCanine on the right of the picture is much longer then canine on the other side. Look at how it reaches down touching you lip, while the other does not. Maybe also the premolar on the right side has the same issue. All upper teeth on the right side look slightly slanted, too. All things that can be fixed with invisalign.Invisalign isnt a miracle worker. Youve got a canted jaw which can only be fixed with surgery. For Invisalign, thats probably as good as it can possibly be. It doesnt fix everything. So youd need to seek alternative treatment for a better result than that.They look great and a massive improvement from where you started.\\nMy current teeth are very similar to your final results but with flaring of my front teeth outwards and my upper arch is off-center. I was deemed not suitable for invisalign unfortunately and will have to go with braces. Unfortunately there are some cases that invisalign is unable to correct.\\n\\nDid your dentist say that you would need braces or can invisalign refinements further improve your results if you wish to do so?No he was telling me invisaligns can\\'t do much more in this case. He advised either braces or a lingual type of brace. I feel like he was trying to sell me into those tbhYour teeth look so good! I wonder if you will like the results better once you get your attachments off (that\\'s one of the issues I\\'m also dealing with). Also, don\\'t be afraid to ask what refinement trays could do for you. If this is the best that can be done (which look great, btw), ok fine, but make sure your dentist/ortho is answering all the questions you have. Invisalign isn\\'t cheap so you have the right to make informed decisions. Good luck with everything! Either way, I think your teeth look fab!I LOVE YOUR CANINES!!!!!!!Really lol? That\\'s my biggest concern lmaoOmg I think its so cool to have fangs both upper and lower! \\n\\nKeep them fangs!!!!!!How can I post a new picture in this existing post?Nice progress! I also noticed your clear button, mine is silver, but its on a molar, so its okay.You do have to remember a lot of the final results we see are after someones had bonding and stuff done too, your teeth look greatdid you ask your dentist exactly what would have been done differently or what they see could have been improved more? I hate getting vague criticism!In the before picture your jaw doesn\\'t look canted at all.  \\nIn the after picture all the teeth on the right side look \"longer\" and slanted. But the jaw still does not look canted.  \\nI had a lateral incisor that ended up to be longer than the other one (after being straightened), so that the jaw looked canted. That incisor was \"pushed back\" into the jaw by my ortho, using invisalign. Also I had a central incisor that was slanted on one side, and the ortho straightened it using invisalign.   \\nIf the only way to fix your teeth properly is spending more money,  I suggest that you change ortho. Maybe ask your dentist what he would suggest to make your teeth actually straight. But if you paid for invisalign full, your current ortho should go on with further refinements till the final goal is reached. Provided he is capable to do it...I mean, your jaw *looks* canted because of the position of the teeth, but the actual bone does not seem canted to me. Same as it was with me before refinements.I personally have teeth almost exactly like yours. I had regular braces in 2013 and didnt realize until this year that I had a canted smile even though my teeth were straight - they just werent straight in relation to the rest of my face lol. \\n\\nI will be getting Invisalign to fix the cantedness and the base treatment only takes 14 weeks. I would look into this further. I personally wouldnt be satisfiedYou can fix a canted smile with orthodontics?  I truly don\\'t know, but it seems the majority are saying you need surgery.Yep according to my ortho! The projected results are amazing.

As my doctor put it, \"Once you\\'re done, you can fit so much more food in your mouth! ...Not that I\\'m encouraging gluttony...\" I actually had to adjust how I drink out of cups, because my mouth is \"bigger\" than it was before, so I kept dribbling water down my chin when I would drink. …Yes my arch widened even with extractions. I have a much broader smile. All my teeth are lined up nicely, i used to have overlapping bottom teeth.They gave me an expander for 4 months before I started Invisalign to widen mineAh interesting. I don\\'t think my doctor mentioned anything like that.A lot of orthos wont for older patients, Im 24 so when you look it up theres a belief expanders arent effective on people our age. Mine helped a lottt thoughAgreeing that they usually won\\'t mention it. The palate fuses early on (early teens I think), so orthodontists usually suggest surgery. Invisalign alone can\\'t change your palate because that\\'s a fused bone, but it can help make your smile wider. If you want to try to expand your palate to ensure you\\'ll have a wider smile you\\'ll need a more extensive conversation with your orthodontist, which may involve finding another orthodontist who will try a palate expander for adults.I\\'m 47 and my ortho said that we would be widening my arch from a \"V\" shape to more of a \"U\" shape. I\\'m on tray 10/17 and can already see some widening and spacing on my lower arch. \\n\\nMy top front tooth slightly overlapped the other and that has already been resolved. I also had crowding/overlap on the bottom and they are slowly spacing out.\\n\\nLong story short, yes, I think it is reasonable to expect the result from your clincheck.Thanks that was very helpful.It definitely can.

There are quite many of those available here since Invisalign patents are expiring. It's exactly the same thing - attachments, buttons, rubber bands etc. are all included and used as necessary. I got a scan, saw my 3D plan and could request some changes. I will also get as many refinements as needed. I'm 7 months in and super happy with the results already! So I would say don't stress about it and ask them to explain the difference. And if something is unclear ask a million more questions. That's what I did and ended up with a great product and a great ortho. Good luck on your journey!Thank you! I think I'll go for a consultation and ask lots of questions!I use Candid. It cost my 2k.

Thats extremely helpful.I will try this!Any update on your pain? Im finishing up day 2 and Im in agony.

I still am using the dental wax under my tongue. Its not 100% good but my first tray was hell on earth.Ive only had Invisalign but my friends were sharing braces horror stories not too long ago. Someone said they still cant eat baas without flashbacks of it getting stuck in their braces. They talk about pain after tightening. They talk about the brackets against their cheeks leaving imprints. Invisalign sucks for the first 2-3 trays. It does, but then its done and its not bad at all. Ive been in Invisalign for 10 months and do not have a single horror story.I had braces 2 times and now Invisalign. In the very beginning of Invisalign I felt the pain was super similar to braces. In fact I felt the first week of Invisalign hurt more than braces for me, but after I moved on to the second tray it was a breeze. Braces were infinitely more painful because all the teeth were moving at the same time. Every time I would go to get my braces tightened I couldnt eat hard foods for a day or two, but with Invisalign I feel slight soreness in a couple of teeth and it seems to pass super quickly. I really did not want Invisalign in the beginning, but now I would recommend Invisalign to anyone.In as much as pain, my Invisalign treatment has been cake compared to the ceramic braces I wore before. The attachments are no where near as cumbersome or difficult to get used to as the much larger brackets, assorted wires, ties, etc. At the same time, this convo came up in a FB Invisalign group and the general consensus was that Invisalign is easier if you'd worn braces before. Those who've never experienced orthodontic treatment are going to be more uncomfortable regardless. If it's your 2nd or whatever time around, you're accustomed to the sensations, physical changes, etc.My son went through a lot of pain with braces, and a lot of problems (elastics continually breaking, metal wires poking him, etc.)Never had braces but most people and orthos says braces hurt moreI have braces and I did not experience any pain. Not even when my ortho tightens the brackets. I have never had invisalign so can't compare but braces do not hurt.Good for you!  But they do hurt.  Your experience is atypical. ŠYou're lucky! I remember the metal ripping the inside of my mouth up so badly.   \\nThe rings on the molars hurt like hell when put on, the wires stabbed, every tightening was hell for 5 days after, and the brackets rubbed the inside of my cheeks.   \\nIt was not an enjoyable time.Oh my gosh sorry to hear that.

His big issue was his overbite which started off with complete overlap of the bottom teeth. Now you can see about 1/3 of the bottom teeth. So not ideally corrected but big improvement. What Im more concerned about is his front teeth still point a little inwards. The orthodontist says this is because of the overbite so well keep doing more of the same and let it correct little by little. Im tempted to go seek another opinion or two on this. Has anyone else had a similar issue of overbite with teeth angling inward a bit?

I had power ridges to tip the teeth in my trays and bite ramps and elastics for my bite.Same! Has your tilt been fixed pretty well by the ridges? Im on the final 29 trays where that last piece should be fixed. Elastics helped the bite but hoping for a little extra pulling out of the front teeth.I think so! I didnt really notice it before I started going through ortho consults so it was relatively mild but dont have any power ridges on this set and were just kinda tightening up contacts and stuff.I know right its so subtle sometimes! Thanks for the reply.I wonder why our orthodontist has never mentioned the power ridges to us as an option. I'll have to ask her about this.Its like a little indent near the root that they wanna tip so they mightve been on the trays but I think they lost anything beyond flat plastic on the Invisalign pouchesWhat do you mean they lost anything beyond the flat plastic?Ok so I believe this is a Class II, Division II case - the teeth slanting inwards. What are the ways Invisalign can correct this?Im afraid Invisalign wont fix it - I have the exact same overbite and my orthodontist said flat out that it has to be braces. Id go nuts wearing the Invisalign for so long - Ill only have to wear braces 18 months and itll be corrected.Ugh. She clearly said we could go with either. Shes like an Invisalign top provider too so figured she would know.Are his teeth straight otherwise? How dramatic is the slant? 3.5 years is a *long* time to be wearing braces, especially as a kid. If its mostly good, I would close the chapter on this book and he can address it again as an adult if he wants.Yes straight. Its Invisalign so not much of a bother to him. I dont think he would do anything as an adult which is why I want to make them right now, esp after paying $$$$. We were promised X, got 75% of X. Its now or never.My 2 cents: Mental well-being outweighs sucking every last bit of value out of your Invisalign treatment, especially when youre not even the one with the trays in your mouth 20 hours a day for 3.5 years. I would just have a conversation about what your son wants. When you posted a year ago (sorry, Im nosey), your son absolutely hated having them. Is it really worth continuing down this path when his teeth are straight?No, he doesnt mind them. He doesnt wear them 20 hours a day but he always advances to the next tray with no problems. About a year ago the orthodontist glued in a bite ramp with no discussion or warning about it. His molars did not meet when he bit down. It was a rough weekend and then we returned and had it removed. I guess it was a way to speed up the correction of the overbite but it was a shock because there was no discussion of what to expect. He could easily wear the trays another year. I just want to know if more of the same is going to do the trick. The orthodontist suggested correcting the overbite more will cause the front teeth to project out more.Youre very much mummying him  he needed the bite ramp clearly for the treatment. You needed to be firm with him and explain that its necessary instead of pandering to him and getting it removed. The whole point of a bite ramp is to change the way youre biting. The ortho is not obligated to discuss every aspect of treatment with you. Its for them to know and you to go along with. You cant pick and choose which things youre going to follow. If youre not going to accept what your professional is saying then maybe smile direct club is more appropriate for you! „ \\n\\nInvisalign doesnt fix everything.

If the pain is truly unbearable when you go to the next set of trays, I suggest keeping the older ones in a few more days. I initially started on 1 week tray changes and moved to 2 week changes and found the pain dropped exponentially. It gets better and I am so thankful I finally did it.

I had all my adult teeth at a very young age and wisdom teeth began to impact and turn on a 90 degree angle towards my regular teeth which in turn caused the majority of my crowding. (On both my top and bottom arch) I probably should have had my wisdom teeth removed by the second time I had braces, but for whatever reason my Ortho (20+ years ago) didn't recommend it. By the time I was 6 months into my retainers the crowding got so bad I couldn't even use my retainers. At 16 or 17 I had my wisdom teeth extracted, but the damage was long done at that point and my teeth were a mess. Finally in my mid-late 30s (2019) I started Invisalign and I'm almost done. I'm on my final set (hopefully) of refinements. I go back next month to see if I'm finally ready for retainers. It's been a long journey, but it's been worth it.I am also on day 3 and I am feeling the exact same way. I am relying heavily on the comments of Redditors who say itll get better. I have canker sores all around my mouth and tongue trying to adjust and Ive already cracked a tray. Also snacking and enjoying coffee is so much work now! Just wanted to say Im in the same boat and Ive read that what we are experiencing is normal and gets better (gosh I hope so)Im on tray 9 and still feel like its a damn nuisance. Still, I want to keep going to fix my teethI hated them on day 3, even 2 trays in. I have huge sensory issues and having something touch me all the time was hindering my every thought . BUT they really do just become a part of you and you will not notice them after a while I PROMISE!! Enjoy your journey to beautiful teeth!!I have the same kind of sensory issues...pain doesn't bother me, but that low level mildly itchy sensation of something-hugging-my-teeth has been super annoying.I'm on day 4 of my first tray, and it's gotten a lot better. I very nearly cried because of how much it forced me to change my lifestyle. Hell, just yesterday, I woke up starving to the point my entire body was shaky, and it took like all of my energy just to get food. But I'm proud to say I managed to take my aligners out twice in under a minute today and without nearly as much pain as it previously had been (I would sort of quietly yell when trying to remove the upper aligner from my front teeth). It still hurts to chew but not as bad.\\n\\nI had been so excited to start, but for the first few days, I was miserable and accidentally starved myself (though, tbf, I do have a medical condition that already does that and it took me a year to figure that out so I wasn't constantly starving and then Invisalign is making me completely rework all of that...). I'm managing to stick through it because I spent 3.5k on this; it'll hopefully alleve a current problem I have that causes much more pain than this; I'll have straighter, nicer teeth; and it's only temporary plus I know I'll get used to it.This is my first day today and I am already regretting. But the comments here have made me hopeful that good days are just around the corner \\x81I had a total meltdown last week and posted here, too. lol I swear bitching about it helped because I'm feeling so much better and have been wearing the trays non-stop without any issues at all. Hang in there, it gets better.Like everyone else said, the first week is the worst. Afterwards its a lot better and only gets super annoying when youve left them out for too longHonestly, I totally understand. I am a dentist myself and was still regretting my life choices in the first week, but perservered as I see time and time again how our mouths can adapt to changes! Keep going another week and honestly it will fly by \\x9dIm on day five, and its been so hard. I dont think I fully anticipated how annoying the constant pressure would be. Not to mention that I had to figure out how to chew with the attachments on (my bite makes it so that I have two upper teeth totally behind my bottoms, so the attachments on those uppers scraped the back of the bottoms). \\n\\nDouble whammy on this is that I picked up aligners on Wednesday, then had to get foot surgery Thursday morning. Im sure I was all sunshines and rainbows for everyone who had to deal with me.It gets a lot better- for me, it took 5-6 weeks for the jaw pain to ease enough to open my mouth more than an inch. You will get there!By Day 2, I was so over it and totally miserable, especially at the idea of upwards of two years of this. Im now on Day 6 and while things arent perfect, Im starting to see how this could be doable and eventually feel normal.Im in the bite settling stage. I hated my first week. Now, its so odd to not be wearing my aligners. Itll get easier.I was exactly like you the first week. I remember taking me in the dentist's office 5 mins to  take off the aligners and rubber bands and put them back on.   \\nNow, 3 weeks later, I pop them off in 10-15 seconds and pop them on in another 20.\\n\\nIt's crazy how fast you get used to them. Mind you it's still sometimes annyoing ( especially when traveling or when you can't plan your meals) but you'll learn how to adjust, sometimes compromise and it will get much better. And you'll barely notice it in your mouth.\\n\\nWhen I started I gave myself 2 weeks before I started complaining and 1 month before considering to quit  if it would have stayed like the first week.I hated it at first too and kept thinking I made a giant mistake. 10 weeks later Im fine with them. I fact I feel weird when theyre out and want them back in. Hopefully you get used to them too.The first week is the worst! You get used to it, and it just gets to be part of your day. You get used tothe achey teeth, and the trays get looser as you go so they are easier to remove to eat and stuff. Don't worry my friend, it's not like this the whole time \\x81\\x81\\x81On tray 13/28, as I sit here drinking my coffee without them in, I miss them.\\n\\nThe first week is the worst.Im almost the end of my second week and it feels so much more normal now. I cried the first day because I hated how it felt and couldnt stand it. Hang in there!Wow. Seriously. Youre complaining that you can take them out when you need to?\\n\\nI am about to finish my Invisalign journey and have found it to be super easy.You will forget that, it IS easy and so more comfortable and convenient than braces. Just use dental wax for those sharp angles.I hear you.  I had crazy regret my first like, two weeks.  But like everyone here said, it does get better.  Take progress photos so you have something to look back on in a few weeks/months which will help keep you motivated.  Best of luck!My ortho told me I can switch to wired braces if I ever wanted or needed to. Its there in my plan as an alternative if Im not getting on with Invisalign or am finding it a pain. Maybe check your plan to see if this is included with yours too?\\n\\nSeveral of the dental nurses at my surgery have wired braces and one tells me its agony from them cutting the inside of your cheeks and lips. Ill need to switch to wires for refinements, we think. It seems like itll hurt, but on the flipside there will be so much less brace admin every day.You really barely notice it after a few weeks. It's amazing what we can get used to. I've had mine over a year and I'm almost done.So I too, am on day 3. Needless to say I am feeling your pain. I actually have short treatment (20 trays, change every 7 days) but the road seems soooooo long. I don't have pain, just feel like my teeth are getting a hug. But these bite ramps and lisp @$!#! It's gonna make me lose my mind. I am praying this gets better but I promise you I am motivated to do 22 hours so I can get outta this crap.This was me when i started. Even though i had braces for years growing up i wasn't ready for the pain and discomfort of the first few days. 5 weeks in still annoying that can't snack anytime I want like I could with braces, but at most theres a little tightness with each new tray for a day or two. So like everyone said, it gets easierSeriously it gets easier / better. You adapt, your mouth adapts, you create new habits. Stick with it and youll be happy! Im over halfway done and Im really happy with results. Good luck!Hopefully, you'll get over it soon. I did.\\n\\nI'm on only tray 5 (doing 5-7 day cycles), but I am looking forward to new tray days when my teeth are slightly uncomfortable and very snug in the new aligners.

If you think youd struggle with wearing the aligners for 20-22 hours per day and keeping your aligners and teeth clean and brushing/flossing more then I would just go with braces tbh.

Here are the factors I\\'m currently thinking about:\\n\\n1. Aesthetics - I don\\'t think I\\'d look terrible with braces. At 18 I could probably still get away with it, but I\\'m worried I might be conscious about them in college. I\\'m also on the short end (as a male), so the thought of being part of a group and then being labeled as both \"the short one\" and \"the one with the braces\" sounds extremely nightmarish to me. Treatment time was quoted at 20 months so I would likely get them off before I turn 20 or shortly after, so I would have them my first 3 to 4 semesters of college.\\nHowever, I\\'m worried I might get more conscious of them as time goes on, especially on first dates/interviews. Mask wearing may come and go, but there\\'s no guarantees.\\n\\n2. Convenience. Invisalign is a big pain in the butt to take out, brush, floss, etc literally every time you eat. I\\'m certain I would skimp on this, possibly deciding to just rinse or eat a quick snack with the aligners in. This would be worst for parties/gatherings with a lot of food, or especially drinking events where I would be at great risk of losing the aligners, or worse, puking in them (I have heard stories.)\\n\\n\\n3. Function - My case is a minor class 2, but I have heard/seen that braces may provide better results than Invisalign. My ortho who pushes invisalign says they can produce the same results, but I\\'m not sure it\\'s actually true.\\n\\nWhat are your opinions?I personally would not want braces in colleges. I wouldnt even want them now at 29. Which is why for me, the option was Invisalign or nothing. \\n\\nIt can be challenging at times but youre gonna have to learn to deal with it in college in you decide to go with that route. \\n\\nAs far as alcohol, I drink beer and clear alc like vodka or tequila with them AND A STRAW. No red wine or anything that could stain them. Always rinsing with water.\\n\\nIf youre at at house party youre golden, you can munch and brush your teeth peacefully in the bathroom. Yeah you cant snack but it works for weight loss and eating control. If youre at restaurant youre good too. Ive have them for 5 months and I havent come across a time where I actually cannot brush my teeth. \\n\\nBest of luck!I don\\'t have any information or experience regarding braces, but I have been doing Invisalign for the past 8 months (I\\'m on refinements now), on 1-week aligner changes, as an adult (age 28) and I have to say it\\'s REALLY NOT as annoying as it seems or as people make it out to be once you get the hang of it. \\n\\nAll you need is 2-5 extra minutes per meal. Honestly, once you start brushing your teeth after every meal you\\'ll wonder how you let yourself not brush your teeth after every meal before Invisalign! That\\'s 100% how I feel now. I can\\'t believe I was so gross before and just let food particles...fester. \\n\\nIn addition you don\\'t have to full-on brush your teeth if you\\'re out and about and can only do a rinse with water and pop your aligners back in. It\\'s totally fine. As long as you brush your teeth and floss as soon as you can, and on a regular basis keeping your aligners and teeth clean to prevent cavities, you\\'re going to be fine. I only floss at night and I\\'ve been good all this time.agree 100% on everything you said!Invisalign and in college. Works for meCan I ask what you eat? I have to get a takeout box at the dining halls then walk all the way back to the dorm to eat so that I can rinse and brush my teeth afterward. Huge pain. And one time I loaded up on some beef that ended up being too tough to chew but I had nothing else in the dorm and I had class soon so I ended up eating very little and starving. This will probably happen many more times in the future as the school food isn\\'t great. Restaurants like chipotle also an option but going there and taking it back also a hassle.I eat all normal stuff. Just brush and put them back in at home. I do virtual checkups with my ortho with some dental monitoring thing and they say its tracking nicely so guess Im fine.I do often have a little snack, rinse and pop them back in but never wait more than a couple hours to do a real clean. if I KNOW im gunna be eating, i try and pack a travel thing of mouthwash in my bag so I know itll kill some if not all of the bad bacteria. \\n\\nit feels weird to chew with them in so i wouldnt do that/dont know anyone who actually does that. i occasionally drink non clear liquids such as coffee and some soda here and there and ive never had any staining or any new cavities. im just sure to again, clean/brush within a few hours. \\n \\nbraces actually limit the foods you can eat! say goodbye to anything chewy or popcorn or small bits of stuff. even if youre not perfect with invisalign the worse that would happen is it takes you a bit longer. \\n\\nbest advice is to talk to your ortho and see what they recommend. mine made me a comparison with price and estimated time. im so happy i chose invisalign. no one even knows I have it, while its fixing my teeth!Im going to be a freshman in college this fall and definitely didnt want to have braces. Getting my Invisalign trays in 2 weeks from today! Good luck deciding :)Hey, everyone has made some great points about the pros of Invisalign and I agree whole-heartedly. On the, uh, puking front: don\\'t overthink it. At the end of the day, no matter how out of it you are you\\'ll probably want them out and brushed and your teeth brushed so hey ho, you\\'ve cleaned them! Then they\\'re easy to just pop right on and deal with.\\n\\nYou will also get used to the whole floss/brush/mouthwash shebang, it becomes part of daily life - if you\\'re just drinking all night, or can\\'t floss in the moment, rinse or brush before you pop \\'em in and then floss/brush/clean when you get home. It truly is up to you - I\\'ve never had braces. I don\\'t like their appearance and am aware that there are certain things you can\\'t eat with them, and it\\'s harder to floss. But it\\'s a personal choice!I just started Invisalign and Im in college too! I think it makes me a lot less self-conscious because my friends barely noticed until I told them. \\nYou should ask your ortho if hes comfortable with a plan where you can eat with them on. I am eating with them on, and it makes my wear time longer and my life a lot easier! Also, I dont have to worry about taking them out every time I eat or drink. You can also enjoy longer meals, but just make sure to brush your teeth as soon as you can after.Go with invisalign. I had braces in high school and could not imagine having them again now that I\\'m an adult. I have Invisalign lite and I used to be super diligent about brushing and flossing the first couple weeks, but it makes more sense to me now to just put them back in after I finish eating than spend more time with them out to clean them. I deep clean them each morning with Retainer Brite tablets and haven\\'t had any issues with staining or cavities. My teeth have actually gotten whiter.    \\n\\n\\nAdditionally, I live in a big city and go out drinking pretty often; I just take them out. Your case might be different but I can get away without having them in for several hours a day while eating and drinking (or on weekends, going to parties) and my teeth have moved just fine; actually on my last tray now and my ortho hasn\\'t noted any issues.

But now they\\'re cleaner than ever, because I\\'m brushing them more than ever!\\n\\nAlso, the attachments DO help get food stuck, and then it\\'s really hard, sometimes painful to the tongue, trying to get the food out. Sometimes I have to swish with water, or just give in and stick my finger in my mouth...I use a \"for braces\" mouthwash that helps a lot with the pain of the cuts. Maybe check it out and see if it would help?I actually filed mine down a little with a nail file just to take the scratchy bit offIt will get better for sure! I am now on week 4 and have 21 attachments and I think they did bother at first when my mouth felt a little dry from all the trauma from the initial appointment and attempts at taking the aligners out. But I never really feel them anymore.Ok, good to know. I have 22 attachments.Use ortho wax! Its a lifesaver if theyre scratchy but you wont be able to eat with it onPeroxylI got mine about 5 days ago and theyre finally starting to feel better! I used oragel with the antiseptic in it to help heal the cuts.Thanks for all the tips everyone. Im going to look into all the suggested stuff! It just occurred to me.. I wonder if Im biting me cheek more too because my upper arch is being expanded.Itll get better. I struggled a lot the first couple of weeks with attachments and really regretted my decision. Its gotten better. Im on week 10 now and its going well. There are still some foods that I cant stand to eat though because it feels like theres Velcro on my teeth. The attachments get much smoother with time.I\\'m 6 weeks in and they\\'re still annoying the crap out of me. Mine are at the front and are constantly catching on the inside of my lips. I\\'m hoping it\\'ll get better as my teeth shift into place but I\\'m honestly considering asking the ortho if there\\'s a way to do it without attachments.Most likely it will get better.  Im sure it depends on their placement and each individuals anatomy though. Like if your teeth are moving from out to in, then your lips are probably tighter against the attachments until your teeth start moving. \\n\\nMine were terrible at first and just gross feeling; Im 8 weeks in and its not as bad now.Just to counteract what you\\'re hearing here - I\\'ve had attachments 7 months and it hasn\\'t gotten better at allI am only five days in and I agree the attachments are terrible.  I guess the good thing is it makes you want to keep your liners in. Its almost impossible for me to get them out without that hook thing.I just got one of those hook things. Huge help!!!I\\'m on my 19th tray, but I had 3 months waiting for refinements, so I\\'ve been doing this for like 7 months now. At first, I had no attachments on my very back molars, and I could get the trays out with my fingers, but it was so much easier with the hook thing. Now, they added attachments to 3 of those rear molars, and I can\\'t get them out with my fingers anymore! If I don\\'t have my tool, the only way I can do it is my sticking my fingers inside of my mouth, and pulling from the inside of my arch, where there aren\\'t any attachments.\\nIt\\'s crazy!Oh man. Thats why I asked if it was the norm. Because they only get your mouth when the aligners are out which is like what 2 hours a day if your really good at eating quick lol. I was wondering if it makes it difficult for your mouth to get used to them.It gets better ! Mine were giving me mouth sores but now they just feel like my teethMine were pretty sharp. I chewed slowly anyways in the early weeks due to the overall soreness of my gums and the sharpness of the attachments.\\n\\nEventually, they did soften up from constantly switching trays. Although I will point out to keep an eye on that. Too much \"soft/dissolvement\" changes can harm your tracking. I had it happen to me where an attachment felt like it was hardly there. I caught it in time and got it redone so my tracking stayed on time.Yes, it will get better. Your mouth builds up sort of calluses, but it takes a week or two. You\\'re so close!\\n\\nI did have one of my newer attachments, when it was first placed, it had a catchy rough spot, very pointy. I could feel the sharp spot with my finger. So, just like I saw someone else say, I did file that one spot down a tiny little bit. I didn\\'t want to do it so much that I impacted the shape of the attachment at all, but I did just a little bit so that it wasn\\'t super rough in this one area.\\n\\nAs to biting your check, I do not have this problem now, but I sure did when I had braces 15 years ago! You\\'ll just have to chew slowly, and pay close attention for a while. It was like re-learning how to chew. I couldn\\'t smile or talk while chewing. If I needed to smile for some reason, I had to pause chewing to do it. While chewing, I consciously tried to keep my cheeks relaxed and out. Sometimes, I noticed I would kind of suck in my checks while chewing, so I had to train myself to not do that.\\n\\nIt does get better with time. This is a big change for you and your mouth, something both of you have to get used to. But it will happen, and it will become much easier then.', 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'financial concerns', 'tray time management', 'facial appearance', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'oral hygiene'], 'scores': [0.2467842996120453, 0.18632946908473969, 0.14159885048866272, 0.13258549571037292, 0.11619560420513153, 0.09127525985240936, 0.08523096889257431]}, {'sequence': '6 years on treatment. What can I do?Hi all! I just found this sub and I am in need of some help, because Im pretty fed up. \\n\\nI began Invisalign in 2016, I first had a Pendex (roof of mouth spacer with brackets around my molars) for a while, then my trays. The goal is to realign my canines, as they flared out due to baby teeth staying in for too long.\\n\\nI have never completed an entire box of trays. The box is usually for around 40 trays, and they always change something maybe 15-20 trays in. I have had buttons, elastics, attachments and filing done numerous times throughout the years. In 2018, my ortho said he wanted to œadjust my midline\\x9d and then wed be done. Clearly that has not yet happened and I am now 26 years old with a huge gap, attachments on *every* tooth, and 2 elastics per side (one side worn during the day). \\n\\nI did bring up that its been a while, and my ortho says my teeth are very hard to move. Much harder than any of his other patients teeth. He had never told me that before until two appts ago when I said something. He also says that when I began treatment, he had just begun offering Invisalign as well. Hes very accomplished so my family and I had trust. I did not question him over the years due to his level of expertise; I didnt want to overstep and Im not very confrontational. \\n\\nWhen I have asked him how much longer, his answers are vague, he doesnt look at me and he says something like œooh well maybe X months, yeah were almost there!\\x9d.\\n\\nLately, Ive been considering asking for braces and getting this over with. The payment plan was completed around 2.5-3 years ago. I also want to move provinces soon and I just know we wont be done this by then. I dont want to be rude or demanding toward him, but this is getting to be a huge frustration. \\n\\nWhat would you do in this situation?at this point why didnt he just do braces on uPlease ask him that and let me know what he says lol. Im going to inquire about my options at my appt tomorrow.hoping for the best º this is annoying im sorry for uThank you so much. Definitely annoying aahPlease get a second opinion from another orthodontist. This seems like a money grab and possibly medical abuse. Six years is excessive. It may even be appropriate to get a lawyer in the picture.Our payments stopped a while back so Im costing him time and money now. Youre right though there needs to be more action - wether I push for braces or lawyer upJesus, I thought my case was bad at 2 years. I would rather just have crooked teeth than wear Invisalign for that long.Same, Im on my refinement aligners now and Im so close to just being like œtheyre fine now lets take the buttons off and whiten my teeth now\\x9d.Yep. Its getting ridiculous. To the user below: Ive been on refinement for so damn long lol and my ortho doesnt offer whitening - but I dont think Id need it tbh.No ways, no ways! This is unprofessional and abusive if you ask me. Feels like he has nothing to lose dragging it on but you are the one that has been doing this for 6 years. You need to respect yourself enough to stand up for yourself and communicate you would like a definite end date or another solution.Thanks for your comment, Im going to ask about it today or at least set up a meeting with him to chat.Canadian confirmed!\\n\\nYoure to be respected for being kind, but there is nothing confrontational about advocating for yourself. Your ortho of a professional and should be able to take valid questions.  Good luck!Haha youd be right about the Canadian part ! Lol thanks for your words :)Get a second opinion from another orthoThis is a good idea! Thank you.Just for reference I had regular braces for 4+ years partly because I kept missing appointments. I dont think there is an advantage to invisalign if its gonna take the same amount of time as regular braces lolAbsolutely haha. I made nearly all my appts but again, if something wasnt working it was hardly communicated to me.I\\'d be begging to switch to metal braces at this point. I wouldn\\'t back down if I were you.Gonna keep pushing. Thanks for your comment ! Hopefully I can find a solution with him.I hope so. I know lateral incisors and canines are stubborn to move, especially with Invisalign. I needed a rotation on a central incisor that it seemed to not be able to do but braces could. This might help you. Plus some power chains will close gaps.Yup I got a power chain a few months back! My canines are straight. Everything was perfect in 2018 then he decided to refine my midlines and now Im here.So you have metal braces? Power chains aren\\'t used with Invisalign.I have Invisalign. I have buttons glued on for top and bottom elastics that I switch out daily. Across those top two are a power chain.I\\'d love to see how this looks with Invisalign.Idk how to upload pictures yet lol but its just hooked on horizontally between two buttons. Lots of pullFollowing cause I\\'m in a similar boatSorry to hear that :/What was your treatment plan estimate time to finish?When you first get braces or Invisalign they will tell you the estimate time when your treatment is done mine is 18 months they told me or with braces as well. But I know for a fact even your orthodontist told your estimate treatment plan sometimes will take long with Invisalign or braces. I know people who got braces and supposed to be done in 18 months and took them 3 years or moreI honestly dont remember exactly how long. Obviously he did say œfor some it takes longer\\x9d. It definitely wasnt 6 years tho\\n\\nEdit: I remember deciding between braces or Invisalign and because the time estimates were so similar, I opted for the less visible one.Do you mind taking pictures of your teeth currently?You said you started your treatment in 2016 what if you take braces instead Invisalign at that time would braces make a difference I dont know but I know it would take long for you because you said your teeth are hard to move so yea I think it will be the same thing or maybe different. I know people who had braces didnt like it because due to they cant eat everything and also they can break easily. My family and friends I always ask them would you rather have braces or Invisalign most wanted to get Invisalign instead because you can eat everything and easy to brush unlike braces and I got my Invisalign in February 25, 2022 and I wanted to changed after a week to braces because I find out that one of my attachments fall off and I told them I want to finish to braces to the dentist and orthodontist and they all look shock and surprise and they were like Invisalign is more better and if braces break you have to pay for it and they told me they have more emergencies with braces because they keep breaking them and their patients love Invisalign more than braces and I was like I will give it a shot and I love it and I now I about hit one month with Invisalign in march 25, 2022. When I first started my treatment with Invisalign the orthodontist check my teeth and after that he check if I am qualify for Invisalign you got to remember not everyone is qualify for Invisalign and he said I am qualify for Invisalign or braces but the reason I choose Invisalign over braces is because I ask them all which is best for me and they all said Invisalign and they all point out something amazing my orthodontist said if you choose braces I know for a face your not going to hesitate to eat everything and you will break it easily and I was like thats truth and my treatment he estimated is 18 months and once I got my first 8 trays I got 10 attachments on the top on my teeth and six bottom and he never gave me elastics or like that and he told the first 8 trays change them every 7 days and so far I enjoy them and would it be different if I chose braces maybe. I know very well many people who started their braces treatment and at some point they regret getting braces and wanted to switch Invisalign and same with Invisalign patients at one point they wanted to switch to braces but who knowsSo I literally just changed to braces on Friday because I am quite unhappy about what Invisalign has done so far, while it did make my teeth straight, it created a deep bite and my teeth are leaning inwards.  I can say that braces definitely isnt fun, its absolutely less comfortable than Invisalign.  However, I addressed the issues to my ortho, he said that braces will make fixing them easier than Invisalign and possibly shorter.  Normally they would charge $2000 for the change due to noncompliance but for me it was my teeth being stubborn and not moving properly.  I do suggest you let your ortho know that youre not happy about the progress and for them to offer a better solution.  I am only 1 year in and just got changed to braces.  Side note, I am also Canadian from southern Ontario if that helps.Thanks for your input ! Im in Victoria haha. My ortho unfortunately is sick so I didnt get to talk on Sunday, but Ill see him in my next appt in six weeks. He agreed to talk with me then about options. I also have a natural overbite and when I chew my jaw moves back a lot. That was always a thing for me tho.I was in Victoria for 2 days in September, what a nice city!  I miss the food there!\\n\\nHonestly it doesnt matter how your bite came, whether its natural or from the treatment, its still supposed to be fixed.  You didnt pay the big bucks just for them to give you the run around.  I would even suggest demanding an earlier appointment because 6 weeks is so long!  I would be angry at this point if I were in your shoes.  You paid so much money for your teeth to be perfect!  I wish you best of luck with this!Thanks, yeah Im kind of past the point of anger now Im just on being direct and not taking no for an answer.

I think it seats my aligners good without me having to use chewies so Im okay with itThat was my thinking too. Until I realized today that my molars dont touch anymore and its worrying me that Ive screwed up my bite.Try to avoid clenching because it contributes to posterior open bite.

I recently visited my ortho, paid him to create my clincheck before my treatment began to get a good idea of where I would be at. I would have attachments on one of my lateral incisors, canines, and most of the teeth behind them. Thankfully, none on the front two teeth. My crooked teeth are something that have always bothered me my whole life. My parents never had the money to fix them (to my dismay) and now I am make enough money that I could easily throw money at the problem, however, I just can\\'t help shake the feeling of embarrassment of wearing \"braces\" at my  age. \\n\\nI find the biggest problem is people in my career path, tend to come from wealthier backgrounds and already have perfect smiles. I already feel insecure that my teeth are so bad compared to theirs, but I can\\'t help shake the feeling that if I decided to \"fix\" them I would somehow feel inferior to them for the estimated 12 month treatment time. \\n\\nI am upset at myself for having concerns that a middle schooler would probably have, but I am human and am looking for guidance.Im 34 and about to get clear braces! I think the opposite: It shows how much you care about yourself - taking care of your teeth is the best act of self care! And as my mother said, œYoull be wearing a 6k accessory you paid for yourself, show them off!\\x9dI can promise you, you are the only person thinking these thoughts. No one is going to care whether you get a mouthful of metal, or invisalign with some attachments. Save for the initial seconds where they might first notice it. You\\'re overthinking it big time!The sooner you start, the sooner you will finish. Also the alternative is that you never start or start later, so you will still be worried about it. So you will worry either way - you only need to decide which worry is better - the one that you finish with it sooner or the one that you finish with it later or never. I know it is often not really that simple, but it might help with the anxiety you are feeling.\\n\\nAlso, it might sound scary reading this sub and learning about it and it might feel scary for first few weeks, but then you actually get used to it and all the ritual around it. I also don\\'t think most people see Invisalign or getting any teeth work done as an insecurity, but more like taking care of yourself and your health.Agree! When I found out I would only need to wear invislaign for 10 months, my first thought was \"in the amount of time I spent deliberating it, I could have done this 5 times over!\"27 year old here, I gave/give no fucks. I guarantee no one is going to judge you, and if they do, those are the kind of people you dont want to be around anyway. Good luck!The fact that youre choosing to better yourself by taking this leap is an attractive quality it itself! I have attachments on all my teeth except for 1 top front incisor and have a job where I am meeting with clients all day everyday in a high profile setting- not ONE person has ever noticed! If I tell them I have braces, theyre always shocked.I am also in my mid twenties and getting clear braces next week. My parents never had the money or concern to fix my teeth but as I grew older I knew this was something I wanted to do. As a teacher, I see a lot of students with nice teeth/on their journey to nice teeth and I often feel œsilly\\x9d for soon looking like them even though I am an adult. Not to mention how inferior Id feel as a young teacher who is wearing braces to the older more experienced teachers. I go back and forth with this alot but it all comes down to what makes me happy. This is something I have always wanted to fix, and now I can. Yes it may seem a bit weird at first but youre doing this to better yourself and the 12 months are nothing in compared to the years ahead where youll have to his your smile and be self cautious instead. At the end of the day, its something you want to do and something you can afford to do. Its not an overnight fix like most œcosmetic\\x9d surgeries these days but its gotta get worse before it gets better. You can do this!!Think of the long term. Past the 12 months. You have a lifetime of straight teeth ahead. This one year might be awkward at times but after that youll have way more less awkward moments with straighter teeth which will give you more confidence.I\\'ve found that a LOT of people who had braces in their teens end up getting them again in their 20s/30s and beyond because they didn\\'t wear their retainer as a teen. Most people- if they are thinking about your orthodontics at all- will probably just group you in with those folks! If it helps, tell everybody you never wore your retainer as a teenager...maybe they\\'ll think you were so rich growing up you could afford to sabotage teeth it took like $5000 to correct, haha! I look at people who have crooked teeth now- but who had braces as a teen- like \"wow must be nice to be so rich you could not wear your retainer and let things lapse.\"\\\\*  (hey- whatever helps you get through it!). \\n\\nP.S. I also work in a field known for attracting people from a privileged background and it\\'s a given that everybody has perfect this, that and the other. It\\'s such a catch-22. I\\'ve been told I would need to fix my teeth to be taken seriously in my field (by a relative, no less!) yet, in a field where appearances are apparently so important, how would people regard me with a mouth full of braces in my 30s? So I get it! I have attachments on most teeth, and am getting them on my front teeth for the last few months. I\\'m totally over it by now...I thought in the beginning I would be afraid to open my mouth but I really don\\'t care. I\\'m one step closer to getting rid of this obstacle what has consumed me for the last 10 years- my wonky teeth! And I have never once felt like I was judged for having braces (invisalign at that). Most people have the same mindset that posters below have- it\\'s awesome that you\\'re able to recognize that something bothers you, and that you\\'re proactive about fixing it. \\n\\n\\\\*I don\\'t mean to disrespect anyone who had braces and didn\\'t wear their retainer- I know they didn\\'t do so out of wanton privilege (!) and that most people (including their parents/guardians) just didn\\'t really understand how this would affect them in the long term.Im 30, and just got Invisalign after always wanting to do it. My mom couldnt afford it for me as much as she wanted to. Id be lying if I said I wasnt self conscious about them sometimes, but I also feel like a lot of adults get Invisalign now, even some with near-perfect teeth already, just as an aesthetic investment for themselves like any other cosmetic procedure. Also, I am kind of proud that Im able to do this for myself now and Id rather feel self-conscious about my smile for another year instead of the rest of my life.Your situation sounds exactly like mine - my teeth have always been crooked and only in the last few years have I been brave enough to smile with my mouth open.  I\\'m 38.\\n\\nA lot of people told me they didn\\'t even notice they were crooked in the first place, which shows you how little attention people pay.  Also... who cares what they think?  Mine aren\\'t excrutiatingly bad, admittedly, but my two fronts on the top overlap eachother and causes one to stick out a bit (my brother calls it \\'ol chopper\\' - which I\\'m not sad about.  We both say it, lol.  If you don\\'t laugh, you cry, so at my age you gotta pick!).\\n\\nI have 11 attachments but my very fronts were spared.  My friend who I sit by at work has them on all her fronts and is jealous of my lack thereof, but honestly you can\\'t see hers like she feels like we can.  I\\'m on tray 2 of 32, she\\'s on 9 of 33.  They do feel awful against your inner lips when your aligners are out, but honestly it\\'s just more motivation to keep them in there.\\n\\nDon\\'t be embarrassed.  If I\\'m 38 and have only just been able to afford it, being in your mid 20\\'s you\\'re doing just fine.

A day or two of feeling (unreasonbly) bashful is very doable. :) <3Im your age and have a bunch of attachments and a lot of my friends (even close friends) literally didnt even know I had Invisalign until the moment I took the aligners out right in front of them when we were about to eat.\\n\\nEveryones case is different but thats my two cents, it should be fine.And if I am being totally vulnerable, I feel like I would not mind the treatment at all if it wasn\\'t for this girl I am currently talking to. She is interested in me, and always tells me how she loves how much she loves how \"I am able to myself\" \\n\\nI just feel like it would be a huge turnoff to her if I decided to show insecurity by showing up to our next meeting with braces in. I know that she probably(?) wouldn\\'t care, and if she was seriously interested, why would she care about braces in the short term, if she already is putting up with my crooked ass teeth, but I just don\\'t know...3I will tell you unequivocally that bettering yourself is extremely attractive to women.  After getting Invisalign its pretty amazing how many people notice and give good comments. Its a conversation starter.Do not worry about that. My boyfriend didnt love his teeth since we met though I never had an issue with them. We now are doing Invisalign together and hes much happier!  I did it to fix my bite on one side as my braces came off too early, his is from never wearing retainers. The confidence boost will be amazing!I just started treatment at 28 and immediately had similar thoughts. I was so embarrassed to go home and show my partner and friends who always found my gap endearing or didnt notice I had concerns about my smile. No one reacted poorly because a supportive friend or partner will want to support decisions that work for you or make you happy! And if they dont, maybe theyre not worth keeping around. At the end of the day its your body and life and you have to do what will make you comfortable and happy regardless of anyone elses opinion. \\n\\nPlus fixing teeth goes beyond aesthetics so it doesnt mean you dont love yourself. Poor teeth alignment can cause gum, jaw and teeth issues. Sure my gap added character but my bottom teeth were crowding so bad one started to crack, I had to fix them so why not fix it all.

But no - I\\'m nearly done. Another three weeks (wearing my last two retainers for 10 days each instead of the 1 week changeovers) and I do some composite bonding and am finished.

It\\'s worth saying I had a really complex bite and we nearly did train track braces instead - he said he\\'s been amazed at how well it turned out.\\n\\nTL;DR: I wore my trays a minimum of 20 hours a day, most days 22 hours, and have ended up having my attachments off early as a result.Im very interested to know what the community make of this. I had a fairly similar experience - they didnt end my initial retainers early but did say I didnt need refinements without even scanning me. I am still unsure whether I was lucky, or if my dedication to wearing my trays for minimum 22 hours a day paid off, or I was simply rushed through to save the dentist a bit of cash. \\n\\nHope youre happy with the result OP and good luck with the whitening :)Im very happy. Worth saying that Im working to a deadline that I made the dentist aware of a year ago, and that I dont need œperfection\\x9d - Ive seen people here get refinements over the tiniest offsets and that doesnt interest me. My bite was crowded and a big mess, and is now largely normal. Because of that, there was chipping on the teeth that mean Ill be getting a lot of composite bonding so the tiny finesse stuff can in someways be œshortcut\\x9d as the bonding will address it. I still have three weeks for the last two retainers so will still finish, Im just doing a whitening treatment at the same time, so the bonding can happen right after.Congrats on this. Happy for you. \\n\\nAll that said, this was your experience. There have been countless number of stories of people being compliant and still not tracking accurately. And plenty of stories of folks just wearing em 16-18 hours a day and still tracking fine. No one truly has all the answers to this. Its always best to follow the rules, but you cant let this shit takeover your life. Still live, and have fun even with Invisalign.Im not sure what your point is here? Ive made clear this was only my experience, and based on some very specific parameters. If youre saying that even people who follow all the guidance dont track right (and I agree, Ive seen plenty here) then your conclusion isyou dont need to? And just œhave fun\\x9d? That doesnt make a lot of sense to me. \\n\\nBut yes, just my experience. The one thing I can say for certain is that good compliance can only help.\\n\\nEdit: the voting and some of the comments off this suggest there\\'s a few people on this sub who think that following the guidelines isn\\'t possible or worth it and doesn\\'t always work so you shouldn\\'t even try. All I can say is I massively disagree.Their point was that the title of your post - being compliant - isnt the answer for everyone due to many variables in treatment and individuals teeth, and that it can be unreasonable to be 100% compliant 100% of the time - to sacrifice a dinner with friends by saying œbut I need to put my aligners in right now or I wont get my 22 hours\\x9dId also agree thats unreasonable and never suggested to do that.

He wants to move my bottom teeth down.  \\n\\n\\nI asked if it\\'d change my smile and he just said something along the lines of \"we\\'re not doing anything aesthetic with this\". I\\'m finding it hard to believe though, that shifting my lower jaw down wouldn\\'t change my face in some way. It wouldn\\'t deter me, I\\'m a bit freaked out at my teeth losing height and want to go forward with the aligners this fall. But I already have confidence issues with my smile, so I just need to have a better idea of what to expect looks wise, so I can prepare myself for the possibility, and not freak out at the end. \\n\\n\\nHoping to hear from others with a deep bite that was bad enough to cause wearing down of teeth, and if shifting them down significantly changed your appearance. He estimates a year to year and a half. \\n\\n\\nThank you!!! I can post pictures of my smile if it\\'d help, but don\\'t have scans or pics from the dr yet.Id say go for it! I had braces to correct my overbite as a teen (teeth were straight to begin with and aesthetically great). Reason for correcting overbite was to avoid top and bottom front teeth constantly rubbing which causes both to get thinner over time and thus chips/breaks to occur. I had fixed retainer over top 2 front teeth and 4 bottom front teeth so no need to wear plastic retainer forever. Years later, my dentist noted I was unable to effectively clean between the retainers and gums, so plaque build up was an issue. Deferring to the expert in the room, I agreed to have both removed. 10 years later and my overbite is terrible (still fine aesthetically as far as I can tell). Bottom teeth have moved and chipped and I can tell wont be long before Ill damage one now and need some sort of expensive fix.. which will likely keep happening to some or all of my front teeth. So disappointing that water flossers didnt really exist then, and cursing myself for not refusing to have them removed! Now considering options for realignment and looking at expensive, painful, and inconvenient solutions - all to essentially redoing the work that was done then. \\n\\nWorried about aesthetics? Stand in front of the mirror and smile with teeth while biting down as usual then adjust your jaw down a couple of millimetres so you can see how this would change your face. It will be subtle, and most likely more attractive (will make face look very lightly longer, thinner, more defined). To assess my overbite to begin with, I was shown that my top teeth completely covered my bottom teeth before, and after braces came up maybe half way of my bottom teeth. Wish I had the before and after pics to share! \\n\\nGood luck and my advice is get it done right now :)Thanks, I appreciate you sharing your experience. I did try lowering my jaw and looked goofy, but it probably looked weird because I was like over exaggerating my smile to see... The Dr said mine would move similarly to what it sounds like yours did. I really should just try... It\\'s so expensive but I really don\\'t want issues down the road with teeth chipping like you say they can.

Ill ask him!Are you trying to gain more via strength training? If so, you could have lost more fat (including in your face) while building muscle.No, Im just eating a lot more and Ive started adding protein powders to my meals too.That can actually help you lose the fat (not weight per se). There\\'s this diet I do where I\\'m eating sooooo much food and upping my protein using protein powder and in 6 weeks I may lose 5-10 lbs, but I\\'m like 2 sizes smaller. Your face looks thinner, just look at the bottom picture compared to the top, you can see where the area below your cheeks are hollowing out (weight loss). Don\\'t think that eating more necessarily means \"gaining weight\". It depends on what you\\'re eating. Just something to think about.This. Macros and tracking makes a difference not just \"eat more, eat less\".Same. Gained.But your jaw/ face seemingly looks way smaller ?  So maybe its face fat loss but it really changed your jawYeah thats whats so weird. The rest of me looks normal and the scale looks good, but my face is slimming down weirdly.You dont look older if anything your face looks well lifted and structured and youthful!AgreedI agree with this.I was thinking this too. It looks like she used to have difficulty closing her lips and now doesnt, and has more angles in the face. I think the after looks better personally!I agree! Theres more dimensionality to the face now and the cheek bones are more defined! Either way, they\\'re all pretty.I wholeheartedly agree....Thank you, thats nice of you to say!I love how well defined your jaw looks in week 6.Thank you, thats very kind of you!Youre likely clenching and strengthening the muscles in your jaw. \\n\\nHowever, if youre hyper focusing on minor changes in your face and specifically hyper focusing on aging, I 100% recommend limiting your social media access and even potentially seeking therapy. Minor changes like this are not enough to put that much effort into and it is hardly noticeable to be considered œaging\\x9d. If youre clenching it will go away once youre done with the trays. I remember seeing this the first time you posted it and youre still focusing enough to post it online, Id honestly focus on your emotional and mental health.Thank you for caring about my mental health. Im in therapy (and its going well haha) so dont worry! The main reason Im posting this online is because I cant find many posts about similar experiences, and the response from my orthodontist to my questions are making me feel like I am crazy for noticing a difference. I want to post this because I want people who search for this to find more detailed posts with pictures of faces and not just teeth, so we all feel less alone. Thats also why Im updating, because several people have responded to my previous thread who also notice a difference. \\nI want to feel like I am not crazy and I want to feel support. But of course I realize there is a limit to how much you should care about your appearance. Its just that I was recommended this particular treatment (by my orthodontist) because I liked my face and wanted it to change as little as possible haha.  \\nI am clenching at night, so that might be the issue! Thank you for your advice.This comes up OFTEN on skincare subs and a lot of it stems from social media current obsession with marketing anti aging to women. The constant filtering and edits of nasolabial folds in photos online as well as constant sales of things like œpreventative Botox\\x9d are just marketing. The expense of it is a lot of mid 20s women thinking theyre rapidly aging and specifically being hyper critical of their own faces. Beyond caring for it, we really shouldnt be policing minor changes over time.\\n\\nHowever, invisilign makes you clench. In my case I sit and chew on my aligners and squeak the bubbles out of it all day. My jaw muscles and neck/face tension have sky rocketed because of it. Ive thought of getting Botox in the back of my head to reduce tension and relax my facial muscles due to clenching my invisilign. This 100% changed my face shape. Changing your teeth alignment will also add symmetry to your face depending on how your teeth were shaped. You may also hollow out certain areas if your teeth are being moved back. So yes, it can change your face. But I think its important to remember a change isnt automatically œrapidly aging\\x9d, and to most people who arent actively reviewing changes of your face, they wont notice. Hell most people havent even noticed I have plastic trays over my teeth and I show my teeth regularly.Yeah, I agree that social media is not good for our view of what is normal and not. However, I dont mind aging (Im soon turning 31 so Im expecting some more wrinkles in the coming years haha). But this is only in six weeks. It doesnt feel like my normal aging rate.\\nBut clenching might be the cause. Im constantly trying to get how Im supposed to position my jaws with bite ramps. Thank you!My face changed to be more defined and I loved it. I was surprised to see you were 31, your lower half seems like you are in your 20s. I love the shape of your jawline.\\n\\nI agree with the commenter, we hyperfixate on these things due to social media and marketing and all this nonsense aimed to make us feel bad over things other people don\\'t even notice.\\n\\nIn addition the pictures all seem to be taken in slightly different light makes a huge differenceIn contrast to most of the comments here, **my ortho actually told me and warned me about this.** \\n\\nHe said as I have an overbite, if top teeth go back a bit, I will see more pronounced folds. He gave me the option of having the teeth go back just slightly (so I don\\'t see them much) or just go back fully (where he warned me that I may look older).\\n\\nHe told me he\\'s had patients who were distraught by by the presence of the folds so he warns all his patients. So I opted for pulling my back teeth slightly. Now that my intial trays are done I don\\'t mind the folds so much and actually asked to pull my teeth back more with my refinements. \\n\\nIf you\\'re due for refinements, perhaps you can speak to your ortho about how to adjust the next round of trays so that the folds don\\'t deepen. But please don\\'t be so disheartened, you\\'re still as lovely as you always are; some folds don\\'t change that! Best of luck.Hey thank you very for all the informations. I have a minor overbite too but I don\\'t want to correct it since I think it give me plumper lips and a better facial definition (i have almost no cheekbones) but I planned in the futur to make my smile and my arch wider do you think it\\'s possible without correcting the overbite?\\n\\nThanksThe bite ramps make you hold your teeth further apart than normal which elongates your face a bit.I think your face looks more definedThank you!Each picture is posed slightly different using varying small muscles. A small pout goes a long way when moving around the fleshy skin stuff; in addition, the lighting is different as well. Someone mentioned clenching, which could do something, but I dont think theres anything drastic going on here. Facial structure looks great.I tried to get the same angle at the same spot, but youre right, its slightly different. No, the changes are pretty minor right now, just hoping it wont change much more since Ill be having them for like two years haha! Thank you!I think everyone will have slight changes with treatment, it only makes sense. Hyper-fixating is normal, but might be something to address too. I definitely still notice weird things after treatment but the cost-benefit gets me over it, my smile confidence went from 0-80 lol. Something I noticed after treatment with a retainer at night is that my back molars are shifting since the retainer doesnt cover them, likely due to me clenching hard at night - if you notice anything like that, bring it up with your ortho. Thats something they can measure and be on top of. Aside from that, enjoy the teeth!Thank you, yeah the thought of potentially straight teeth of course still keeps me going! Hoping it will be worth it in the end.Before has mouth slightly open, second pic more closed than third, so yup, I agree with posture.Omg the exact same thing happened to me, like my cheeks have hollowed out. My weight hasnt changed so idk what it isSameRight! Its so weird that the face hollows out without losing weight. Never experienced something like this before.It does look like the lines around your mouth are a lot more prominent now. This is also something I\\'m worried about so I\\'m in the same boat! I\\'m on tray 1 and noticed that the way my mouth is at rest has completely changed. My tongue used to rest on the roof of my mouth when it was closed but now I noticed that my mouth is almost always tense and my tongue is always pushing on my front teeth if that makes sense. I think that can definitely impact the way the lower half of face looks..especially if it\\'s been a couple of months since you\\'ve had your trays in. I\\'m trying to work on relaxing my mouth but it\\'s definitely not easy!Saaame I am a dancer and I can see a huge difference in my mouth when I dance in videos now. Horse mouth ha. Im only on my second tray so hopefully it will get better ¹ï¸\\x8fOmgggg yes! Im on tray 30 and still havent figured out how to relax my mouth! It doesnt help that I have a deviated septum and tend to mouth breath sometimes.I also clench my teeth with my Invisalign. And 100% notice a difference in my face, especially with my smile lines when I do so. I hated it so much I started getting a little Botox in my jaw to help. \\n\\nThe small amount of Botox was amazing I had to switch doctors and my new doctor put way too much in and it caused my face to become way thinner. Which I am not happy about.\\n\\nMy sister has gotten Botox in her jaw to help with clenching as well and it didnt help so she then tried acupuncture and she hasnt clenched for six months!\\n\\nI would recommend acupuncture over Botox!I have wondered if my lines are becoming more prominent. I think for me, I am so more hyper-aware of my teeth now. I am looking at them in the mirror all the time to make sure my aligner is snug, I am doing chewies, I am flossing more, taking the trays out and putting them in. I think all of this is kind of stretching out my mouth a bit more than I normally would in a day and making those lines a little more noticeable. Im hoping that after all this is over, it will go away, but I dont know for sure.Actually I love your face structure in week 6. Its sharply defined and beautiful.Aw, thank you!I say roll with it. Change can be scary & even make you initially hate it bc youre used to what you look like. From an outside perspective of a complete stranger, I think it truly looks better! And youve got the perfect Cupid bow lipsYeah, I really dont like it when things are changing this fast. But youre right, that might be the best thing to do! Thank you, thats very sweet of you!Thats totally understandable!!! I had a melt down when i first signed up for Invisalign fearing Ill hate my smile when Im done. Nearly had a whole therapy session with my dentist girls haha! But I bet youll love the final product! Trust the process, itll all work out! Hope everyone here helps make you feel a bit better !I agree with this comment. You look more refined. I find it more attractive for what it\\'s worth.Your face structure is better now. Seems you had overbite before thats been fixed.Something similar happened to me too but with regular braces. I got them off cause I didnt like the changes. (sunken in face) My orthodontist kept denying it which was super frustratingThats strange! I know, its super frustrating when they wont acknowledge it. Did your face go back to normal when you removed your braces?Sorry late reply! It did for the most part although I didnt have braces for very long. But I can definitely see my masseter muscle and cheek just doesnt look the same as beforeHow long did you have your braces for?Looks the same to me and its hard to tell as your mouth is open in the before and closed in week 6 so maybe thats why you think it looks differentI thought my Invisalign was changing the way my mouth looks too lol. I feel like I cant close my lips as easily & it looks so odd. I thought I was the only one lol. It definitely looks worse when my trays are in.You definitely dont look older and it looks so much better than before! I had the exact same sort of shape before I started and I hated it lol! You look more defined and well structured in week six. Its definitely not something be upset about! Its hard to stay motivated when things change so quickly, my teeth are looking so whack at the moment because of how theyre changing but you just gotta push through! \\n\\nYoull love the end result. Keep thinking of that!Straightening your teeth can most definitely change your face LMAO I dont know what your Ortho is talking about. \\n\\nMy face changed a lot as well. Its longer and more angular? I guess thats the right way to say it. Ive noticed that my laugh lines are more prominent now, just like yours are. And that makes us look older. Its not bad thoI think this is from the bite ramps, because it takes the pressure off of your masseters and allows them to shrink. I have had masseter Botox and currently have bite ramps and have the same effect, although more pronounced, so I totally relate! \\n\\nA couple things- youre beautiful in all of the photos. A lot of people specifically seek the look in the last photo and get treatment for this purpose, so even if its not what you were going for, its a different type of beauty. And lastly, this is super temporary (and subtle)- everything changes all of the time. Its a normal and natural part of being human to grow and change. \\n\\nAll of that said- you can always choose not to have the bite ramps on your retainers. For me, when Ive abstained from the Botox and my masseters have re-bulked, my face regained the fullness of your original photo and my nasolabial folds softened because those muscles pulled the skin back slightly. Keep in mind there may be other reasons to choose to have bite ramps, such as avoiding TMJ symptoms.Thank you so much for your comment, thats a relief. That might be the cause! I didnt know you could chose not to have bite ramps. Ill ask my orthodontist to explain more about them and if I could remove them. I have a deep bite but I liked that and told him I didnt want to fix that, but either he didnt listen or he is using the bite ramps for a different purpose maybe.Im going through the same. I feel like my nasolabial folds are SO much more prominent. I also hold my chin so weirdly like I have to strain it to close my mouth all the way, which makes my face look so weird (because of my bite ramps). I am very self conscious about it, even on tray 15. Cant wait to be done.\\n\\nETA: and my cheeks are hollow, like a skeleton.  I do look better when I take my trays out though which is reassuring.My ortho told me my face and even the fullness of my lips would change because your teeth moving changes how your lips law and how your jaw sits. So I think it makes sense!My face also changed over two years of Invisalign. Im bummed about it as well. Its droopier around my mouth and I look older, too. For now, I got a lip filler and it worked pretty well. Just one syringe to make lips a bit fuller but not necessarily noticeable. It lifted the corners of my mouth as well. Im not sure what Im going to do as I age. The teeth look great but since theyve been collectively moved inward, the upper lip will remain droopier. Lip filler will probably sustain me for the next decade but then I will either give up or find some sort of procedure for the area around the mouth. Its a bit disappointing I agree.This looks like normal facial fat loss from aging tbh. I think it looks more defined!Yeah, I think so too. Except that Its only six weeks in between the pictures. But thank you!Wow you look older in 6 weeks because your face looks bonny and less filled, maybe the Invisalign are forcing you changing how you bite, or how your face rest accentuating the look.Yeah that might be the cause. Thank you!I had the same thing happen to my facial structure. I had extractions done prior to starting treatment so Im not sure why the facial structure changed on Invisalign. I didnt know it would change that way or why.It might because the soreness caused by trays make you chew leas and lost muscles on faceThat might be the cause!I truly dont see any difference other than lighting.I have a lot of thoughts on this because Im in a similar boat. Before Invisalign, I got obsessed with skin care and honestly it really messed with my head and my self-perception. I could never get my skin to where I wanted it to be and I had so many negative thoughts about myself. So going into Invisalign I set an intention to not hyperfixate. Its really hard not to but Im trying. Weirdly, I have noticed a similar thing in my own face that my lines around my mouth are ever so slightly more defined and my jaw is a bit narrower. I have no idea why other than thinking my bite is different. You do look different in the three pictures but it could be the lighting, your sodium intake, water intake, how moisturized your skin is, and angle of the camera, the way your face is resting, a number of things. Or it could be that you look different, but you have great bone structure and features, your face is symmetrical, and your teeth are going to look great! Hardly anyone sees us with our face stagt like that and no one nitpicks our faces the way we do. Youre doing great :)My dad and fiancÃ say my face has changed since Ive started Invisalign as well! So crazySometimes I look in the mirror and I\\'m horrified because my cheeks look so sunken in. \\n\\nI always panic and think \"when tf did I lose weight?!\" \\n\\nFor me, it is always either that I am currently dehydrated,  or that I need to release the knot that I get in my masseter muscle. (The knot/my bite is the main reason I am doing invisalign and it is improving a lot!)\\n\\nFocus tomorrow on chugging a whole glass or bottle of water the moment you wake up, and a whole one at least each time you have a meal. Obviously,  only if you think maybe you aren\\'t drinking enough water though since idk your routines lol.I would sincerely bet its just because theres something in your actual mouth (so will revert back over a few months when youre done), and youre probably a bit more dehydrated , its so subtle I think nothing to worry about !Did you have an overbite? It looks like you had an overbite with a receded mandible and the Invisalign is bringing your mandible forward. This is good! Its the first thing I noticed because I had the exact same thing. Your chin will look longer from the front (as demonstrated in your pictures) and more defined from the side.\\n\\nI dont know much about the nasolabial folds but it looks like youve already gotten some good explanations there.\\n\\nI think you look great! I recommend comparing an old picture of your profile to your new profile and you might be a little happier with the results ŠMy ortho said my chin would change a bit with use since my bite wasnt correct, maybe this happened to you as welltbh i have invaslign currently, been about two years. it has made my jaw line more pronounced and changed my face shape just like yours. so youre definitely not alone in this situation lolI can see where youre coming from.  I also want to mention that the lighting is a bit different in all 3 pictures so that can be a reason.  You mentioned you have bite ramps and cant bite down, it could also be a reason too.  I also feel the same about aging during treatment so I am hoping I dont feel the same by the end of my treatment.My face changed in a similar way when I had braces and bite ramps. I think its due to the bite changing making you use different facial muscles when chewing, talking and smiling. My face went back to normal when I got the bite ramps removed.Thats a relief to hear! Ill ask my orthodontist if and when my bite ramps will go away!I had an overbite so my face shape changed but its more symmetrical and my lips dont œprotrude\\x9d as much from the side. Im happy with the changes though. Jaw line is also more defined.Im sorry that you are going through this! Your cheeks do look like theyve hollowed out a tiny bit (similar to the effects of a buccal fat removal). Personally, I think it looks great and gives a œsupermodel look\\x9d for you! \\n\\nAlso, I had bite ramps too and it changed the position of my tongue. Maybe its causing your tongue position to change which is leading to a change of face. \\n\\nIf you do not like it, then you can a) gain weight to get a fuller face b) get filler in your cheeks to add volume back c) stop Invisalign or d) wait until youre done Invisalign”especially the bite ramps” and see if your facial fullness returns.I personally think you look better. People would kill for a jawline like yours.This is something I was afraid was going to happen to me, it did happen to me and all I can say is..\\n From the experience of my friends, your face returns back after the treatment if you are under 35.Im sorry that happened to you too, but Im glad to hear its normal again for you! Thank you, I am under 35 so I hope thats the case for me too!I\\'m still in the process but I\\'m just glad that it did not worsen after 2 months (I\\'m in my 6th month). \\n\\nFingers crossed my face will return. If no, I\\'ll embrace my new bitch face lmao :D[removed]Self-deprecating humor, pls.Yeah you do look a lot older, almost like you have aged 5-8 years. \\n\\nTry drinking more water.Its not the Invisalign. It could be your jaw itself and the muscles in your face, trying to overcompensate for the trays and your bite as its adjusting. Invisalign wont change your face drastically.Especially not in such a short frame of time!This is a really good point. Ive been thinking something like that too! Thank youI dont know if you look any older but your face does look slimmer. Your jaw is more defined. It looks good. However, if this is not what you expected or wanted then its concerning because your jaw does appear to be changing. \\n\\nPlease keep us posted.  I have a consultation this week and Im very concerned about my jawline changing.Your lip look fuller than before \\nI think it looks good!I think you look great in all of em.I dont care what anyone else says, Invisalign definitely changed mines too. I dont like it so much. Its such a small difference that I myself Can notice.My entire face changed shape from Invisalign- post is on my page if you want to see. However, I was very happy about this. Anyway your ortho is crazy if they said it cant change you cause girllllll let me tell youWoah! Im going through the same (5 months in -  currently finishing 11th tray) i am underweight and havent really lost weight but my lines are so prominent. I have bite ramps and cannot close my mouth with those. One thing my dentist friend said that because I am not chewing enough (i eat easy food lol) facial muscles probably have been weakened as well \\xadIm sorry youre also going through this, but thank god there are others who are having a similar experience so we know we are not crazy! When did you notice the change? Are your cheeks and temples also sunken in? And did your dentist friend think it will be ok when you are done? One of my best friends is dental technician, and shes also helping me so much researching this.I think by the 3rd month mark (bi-weekly changes) ive been noticing those lines but one side is more visible for me :(  yes my friend said it would be better once im done. I was already underweight so I dont want my cheek bones to stick out..Cant wait to be done! Has your diet changed? Because my bite is changing, i cannot chew properly so I avoid certain foods (beef, etc.) \\xadI am super late in this but I wanted to chime in because I am experiencing the exact same thing! 7 weeks in with bite ramps and Ive noticed my elongated face since day 1! I also find my lip positioning to be quite weird due to the bite ramps and not being able to bite down all the way. My resting mouth position looks quite.. disgruntled? When I take my Invisalign out, my face and lips look normal again, and Im trying to be hopeful that my new bite wont change my face that much! Good luck on your journey!!Your face will change many times during the process and may well end up very much as it started. The teeth sometimes have to be spread out before they are brought back together. Try to ride it out without too much judgement during the process. I know its weird to see ourselves looking differently than we have come to expect, especially when it changes so quickly. But for why its worth (and I know this isnt your point), your facial structure looks STUNNING.Please dont check out r/orthotropics youll become more obsessed with what your jaw placement is capable of.Thanks a lot lol \\x9dDid you had any extractions? That sometimes happens with extractionsNo extractions! Im expanding my arch.Extractions do the oppositeYou actually look a lot more symmetrical, I honestly envy you hahahaHaha the symmetry is actually the only thing I like so far about these changes. Thank you!The only thing that could possibly be happening is you are biting down on your trays without realizing it strengthening your jaw/masseter muscles. You can get Botox in your masseters to help (I have it FWIW). Google before and after photos.I feel like my masseters are smaller weirdly enough, because my cheeks are more hollowed out, but clenching might have something to do with all of this perhaps. I think Im clenching when I sleep.Honestly I don\\'t sugarcoat stuff and gosh so many people in this comments trying to take care of your feelings rather than telling you the truth. To me you definitely look better before, 6 weeks is really not enough to cause that wrinkle line and people in here actually says that aging? Are they really that ignorant, didn\\'t study biology? But yes something feels off at 6 weeks. You look better before. More youthful and now you kinda look older and your cheeks kinda sunk a bit and can see the curve down your cheeks toward your jawline commonly seen in older people. It makes your face look slimmer like anorexic. Before your face look healthy and youthful after 6 weeks you look like you haven\\'t been eating like corpse bride (Dont be offended I\\'m just telling you what I think because you really look like you don\\'t eat at all like a corpse - the jawline with the sunken cheeks also make you look a bit masculine). Just telling you the truth here because I\\'ve been there and trust me more people would rather lie to take care of your feelings rather than having the heart to tell you what you need to hear. Disappointed by these type of people if you ask me.Thank you for being honest. People irl are also telling me they notice a difference too, and I can clearly see a difference. I really liked the way my face was, so thats why my orthodontist recommended me to expand my arch with Invisalign. I specifically said œI dont want to get a slimmer or more sunken face\\x9d and thats exactly whats happening to me.I bet your orthodontist assured you nothing bad will happen and now it\\'s happening. I went to get braces and asked my dentist if the 4 premolar extractions will affect my face structure. He legit said no. Now my face is literally changing, I get hollow cheeks and starting to get the lines too. Similar to your case but worse since I had the 4 extractions. Wish I had recorded my dentist when he said that so I can sue him. But now i guess the only way is forward. But I\\'m telling you it\\'s getting really hard to trust your dentist/ortho when they literally LIED to your face. My advice, be direct with your ortho and be like idgaf and tell him why your face is changing so much elaborate on the lines, hollow cheeks etc especially when you said you don\\'t want them to change your face. Then maybe you can figure out a solution with him/her. If they try to dismiss you, just make sure you record the whole thing on your phone. And don\\'t leave the office until you get the ortho to explain/ actually answer your questionsYeah something like that. \\nIm sorry this is happening to you. I had the option of removing 4 premolars too, but since I was afraid my face would look sunken I opted for this instead. So these changes seem to be able to happen with or without extractions. \\nI will really try to make him help me with this or at least acknowledge that this is happening.Yes gurl you do that. I got your back you have my full supportThank you! Im rooting for you too!Invisalign can make you snack less, causing weight loss. I lost 6 pounds in my first month.The length of your chin looks longer in the third photo vs the first, are you sure your camera angle is the same? \\nIt looks like youre clenching and your masseter muscle has strengthened which happened to me as well. That also makes your cheekbones look more defined. \\nYour top lip looks lifted too which is interesting.I know when I finished 14 months of Invisalign my masseter muscles are much larger now. I hate it.Im not sure if it was invisalign but I would say the bottom photo looks more defined and beautifulYour face looks more defined which is a good thing. And if its changing your bite itll Change your face a little but its usually for the better. While the trays are in you should look slightly different since theres literally something in your mouthLooks good to me (:I just feel you eaten less because it is painfulCant say due to inconsistencies in photos such as lip incompetence in some and not others, hair in the way creating shadows, and different lighting. You really need a controlled and reproducible environment to be able to look at these photos objectively.I think your jaw looks better, more defined. Prob look younger actuallyInvisalign absolutely can change your face. I do think you look great however. You dont look older to me.Invisalign can change your face shape. It has changed mine.

She has the most beautiful smile Ive seen so thats why I chose her orthodontist.I\\'m halfway through round two now. 32 initial, 19 refinements.\\n\\nI feel your painI feel you! After 44 weeks of initial trays, my teeth are nearly perfect. But nope, another 37 tray set \\xad. My ortho is a picky mf.I had 44 initial trays, 1st refinement =  18 trays, 2nd refinement = 24 trays.  I just started my 3rd refinement = 14 trays.  My ortho praised me for being diligent about wearing time and tracking.  I don\\'t get why they can\\'t squeeze all those movements into one refinement.I knew my orthodontist was going to extend my treatment, but 6 more months??? She also wants me to come in and get my teeth shaved down again at 16 weeks. Trying to stay positive and be excited for a perfect smile but it feels like its taking longer than usual.Yes...with covid I\\'m just over two years now. \\xad\\xad\\xad\\xad But your teeth are looking really good!thank you!! I guess Im just kind of confused because my teeth were never too bad in the first place. 44 weeks total?? GeezI feel the same way. Ive always gotten compliments on my smile; I just wanted to fix a couple of small things. I get rescanned at 28 weeks and will DIE if I get a ton more trays.Sorry, what is the teeth shaving business???when there isnt enough space for them, instead of removing teeth and having a crooked smie, they shave down the sidesWhy cant they just make the palate and the smile wider?some people\\'s jaw bone isnt big enough. I was actually explained by a Lactation Consultant that the jaw is developed during infancy. The muscles of the jaw while properly sucking on the breast, expand the tissue. This might be one of the many complex reasons why a jaw may not accomodate all the teeth.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd maybe something to do with when ortho treatment is done - adult vs early teens. My lower teeth will need to be shaved down in a couple of spots, my jaw is simply not big enoughIt\\'s difficult to widen the actual palate in adults because the two halves that make up the palate fuse together by mid-teens. It can technically be done for some people, but it isn\\'t a common practice and usually palate expansion in adults comes from surgery. Adult orthodontic treatment is slower and more difficult because our structure isn\\'t as malleable, so IPR is the easiest way to correct overcrowding for us.I can see you frustration and wearing aligners is quite a bit of maintece. However, you pay a sh\\\\*t ton of money for profession advice. If you have questions, ask your orthodontist because this is where you get to advocate for yourself. It is frustrating but majority of treatment is more than 6 months. First ortho makes space for all the teeth and aligns them, then refinments make sure the bite and edge to edge alignment is also complete.That makes sense. I trust my orthro I just wasnt expecting it! At least Im getting my moneys worthThe treatment isnt about how it looks, it is the functionality and teeth/gum health. I notice a significant improvement in my tooth sensitivity and my gums arent inflammed anymore.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n I just had my teeth cleaned yesterday and going for rescan. I have 2 micro molars, and while tray 20 looks perfect and smile looks perfect, the 2 micro teeth (with enough root) are no longer touching the surrounding teeth with gaps. So my dentist asked me what is the end goal? If they cannot make the micro teeth touch side to side then I might have to remove the teeth and do implant or do a crown. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter speakign with ortho, they too explained that they first make space for all the teeth, then fix the bite and then address cosmetic issues. I will ask a lot of questions next week during my appointment. I feel the whole experience in a busy office feels rushed and asking questions takes some time by creating that space for yourself through intention prior to the appointmentThank you for that info. I am supposed to be 6 months but the information I have picked up on this site suggests it always goes longer, don\\'t know if I can go any longer, just one month in and dying, however as you noted it\\'s a lot of money to quit!You are so naturally beautiful. Man, I hope they dont give me another set! Im supposed to go back in June and theyll tell me if I need the over correction tray. If not, thats supposed to be it. Did they at least warn you you might get another set, or were they like œsurprise, youre not done (insert evil laugh)\\x9d?I knew I was gonna have some refinements, she mentioned it at my last appointmentThe difference is not only showing In your teeth but also your confidence in your smile!Your smile is looking amazing! I understand being bummed by the setback - Ive had so many things slow down my progress too (stubborn tooth not tracking, things taking much longer to move than my ortho estimated, etc). Sounds like you just have a very good and thorough ortho who wants the results to be perfect, aesthetically and functionally.\\n\\nI see some people on here post that they have to fight to get refiners from their providers who are lazy and brushing them off, which sounds like a nightmare!Off topic, do you mind telling us your skincare routine? Bc..WOW.I use Aveda face wash, moisturizer, then vitamin C in the morning + retinol at night. Im really bad with routine lol Im also wearing foundation in the first pic!!Thank you!Tell that to someone who has been wearing aligners since November 2019 and still have like 4 more trays to go.... Covid pandemic has delayed it so much for me.do they make you pay for the second round?Not typicallynope!Beautiful before and even more beautiful œafter\\x9d cant wait to see more!i wish my ortho would be as thorough as yours! I\\'d rather have an ortho that is a perfectionist than like my guy someone who does not care about your teeth at allLooks really good tho. Did you notice how the face changes after the teeth is straightened?\\nI still got 7 months to goMy smile is definitely wider now. I also lost about 30 pounds from the first pic.I feel your pain. Thought mine were coming off and got another 34! I am on tray 12 of that set now. My teeth are straight but there are still some bite issues. The frustrating thing is I can\\'t see anything changing at this point, but the messages I get are all, \"You\\'re making great progress.\" I get it and will follow my orthodontist\\'s judgement because he is awesome, but damn if it wasn\\'t a gut punch.\\n\\nThat said, your teeth look really good and it will be worth it to have them absolutely perfect in the end.Is it a bite issue maybe?Maybe. When I went initially none of my back teeth touched when my mouth was closed. They do now, but I did have major issues w my bite.Maybe this is what they still want to fix, like aesthetically they look great but probably they want to focus on functionality!Did you notice a difference in your face shape?I think thats more attributed to weight loss but my smile does look wider nowDayummmWhy?One of my front teeth is just the slightest bit crooked. I dont know why its so long.Is that the whole reason? Did your ortho tell you that? Or are they working on some other things? Get your Clincheck video! That way you can tell what\\'s being worked on.Theres some other stuff she mentioned as well, thats just the only real visual reason.what was the other stuff, do you remember?Congrats! Im sure the next 24 trays will fly by though. Your teeth look great but theres probably some other corrections your ortho want to make we cant see, (bite, alignment) which if you dont fix may cause issues later.\\n\\nSince youre already paying so much might as well make it as perfect as you can.Had the same issue yesterday. My refinements came in after 24 initial trays, assumed I\\'d be getting IPR. Nope, another 24 trays!!Wow, they do look great but if they\\'re saying you need more time, I would trust them. I am onto passive trays now while I wait for refinements so I feel your pain. I don\\'t know how much longer treatment will be but trust the process! You\\'ve got a great smile, so now it\\'s about the health and alignment and tweaks to really make it perfect. It\\'ll be worth it!Your teeth look amazing!! I hope mine look like yours when Im done. Also, I know how frustrating it is to keep getting more and more trays. BUT you did pay to have perfect teeth so just stick with it. They already look amazing.Your teeth looked great before this too, btw! Beautiful!I feel it. I had 14 trays and needed another 14 for refinements „A. Absolutely love your username. Very proper and quaint.\\n\\nB. They look amazing but an additional 24 weeks aint nothing. Just keep doing what youre doing and it will fly by! ŒIf it has to do with your bite or something anatomy-wise, I would do it.\\n\\nIf its just cosmetic tweaks, I personally would be done. I cant wait to get rid of these things. Im sure for some people it gets hard to keep perspective but I personally dont need perfect teeth. Near perfect will be enough.Thats my nightmare.  Wtf did they do for the first 29 weeks thenStunning!6 more months!? ±Omg! I think I would just refuse, but good for you for sticking it out. Teeth look awesome! \\x81I actually prefer your teeth and eyebrows before.Hang on there. Refinements are doing its magic ŠI wasnt sure about refinements but they are making it better and better everyday. You look stunningly beautiful and it can only go better.Same I got extra 20 weeks too ! It\\'s worth it afterwardsI mean how much better can it get?I dont see any problem. I would just stop, but that\\'s just methat\\'s because she\\'s got her mouth closedShould I say something to my orthodontist?? Im almost scared that an additional 5 months will make my teeth look weird.Nah, keep going. Once you have the next set of before and afters you\\'ll see it. Besides it\\'s all included in the price right?Your orthodontist knows best and is considering several things that aren\\'t directly connected to how well your teeth look from the outside, such as your bite. \\n\\nGo ahead and ask them why this is necessary, for sure! But then trust their answer. My Invisalign took more than two years - but within the first 8-9 months my teeth already \"looked\" perfect (and coming from a SUPER crooked start - check my post history). The rest was spent adjusting the bite.There is a beauty to unperfect teeth.

Just one thing I wanted to ask that I worry about - were your front teeth wiggly at any point during the treatment? I'm really hoping I don't get this feeling because I think I will panic lol!Haha well I hate to spoil the surprise, but I would say ALL of my teeth were slightly wiggly at some point or another as thats what enables them to move into the correct position. It was a little bit unnerving when I first noticed it, but you quickly grow accustomed to it and realize its all part of the process. The teeth seem to settle back in to their new positions just fine.Thank you for replying!

How long have you been on the Invisalign journey?Thank you!!! °Its been almost 13 months for me (7 day changes).How did it affect your lip size?Hi! Thanks for your question! I guess the size/volume of my lips probably hasnt changed at all, but due to my tooth alignment, my lips are now able to rest in a more œnatural\\x9d position, which appears to give them an illusion of fullness/suppleness.

Its weird I dont have any of those things yet ³I only had one spot for elastics. It was on the left side of my mouth because my bite was slanted on that side. If your bite isnt slanted on that side, they may have determined you dont need elastics. Or, they may see how your treatment goes and decide to put elastics on at a later stage. As for the bite ramps, I cant find my treatment plan at the moment, but I believe I only had them on 4 of my aligner trays.

Tray 1/58. Any advice is welcome!!dont get frustrated with pain or chewing uncomfortable issues you wil get used to it in a few days .. to remove them easier try from the inside corners. flosh your teeth after every meal. wear them for atleast 20 hours. and dont remove them  for long period of times. (like 3 hours)Thanks! I just ate for the first time with the attachments and it was WEIRD lol. Im afraid theyll come off and Ill swallow them, but I guess they wouldnt glue anything to my teeth that was unsafe if I accidentally swallow it! Not attachments, but I broke two of my six buttons pretty much instantly. Then I second guessed if they were ever there to begin with until I got in touch with them. Just getting back from the orthodontist putting them back on. My provider was super cool about it.While I've never lost an attachment, I've lost plenty of buttons since I have to wear elastics and honestly losing them is no big deal. At first I was really embarrassed, but Just make an appointment and get them reattached. I don't think I had to pay for any repairs.What is the difference between buttons and attachments?Attachments are the small squares/triangles they put on your teeth to help move the aligners. Buttons are round, bigger and are stuck on if you need elastics. They dont sit under the aligners.Oh ok. I don't have any buttons then. Is that what they use to adjust your jaw, like having rubber bands with braces?Yeah theyll pull the jaw forwards or straight down or wherever it needs to go. Honestly theyre worse than attachments. They come off a lot easier and they poke more.Sounds terrible.Hope you are getting used to the aligners and not too much pain :)Yes! Im on my 5th tray now and its like theyre not even there. Glad I got through the first week, that was so painful.Depending on how many teeth have to be moved you will experience pain on different teeth and on some trays. I started getting pain again like on tray  10 or 11 on my molars but you get used to it :) . Hang in there !this can happen but most likely if they come off you will try to chew them . anyway its not big deal even if you swallow them your ortho will glue a new oneIve definitely swallowed two of them and my dentist said its totally fine and ok! HahaJust started on Monday, thought I would have a panic attack with the anchors and then putting them on, still having a tough time removing the bottom tray. I literally want to quit and dread putting them back on, but its a costly mistake to quit, good luck to both of us!Dont give up! It takes a while to get use to them. Youll be a pro in no time.Thank you!You know youre supposed to take them off to eat, right?  :)I did, Im talking about the attachments they glued to my teeth!Happy cake day :)Please make sure to cross reference any medical advice you find on this sub or elsewhere on the internet with the opinion of your orthodontist/dentist. Each person has a very unique situation and just because something works for someone, somewhere in the world, doesnt make it safe for you to do. Good luck with your treatment, take lots of progress pics!Oh yeah, as I was just brushing my neon yellow trays I remembered. AVOID TURMERIC LIKE THE PLAUGE. Every month I forget cause Im a gold fish and make the mistake.Dumb question: if you take your trays out to eat, how did turmeric stain them yellow?I think it saturates your saliva, gums, tongue and fleshy mouth bits (think red or blue popsicle). Even after a really good brushing x2 and mouth wash it still will stain. I found if you swish with water between bites it does help clean the mouth before it settles in, but thats just a lot of extra work.Have a travel kit if you go out a lot\\n\\nInvest in a disposible tooth bursh that requires no water/rinse\\nExample: Colgate wisp which is about $4.30 for a bag of 24 or Crest Scope. Mini toothbrush (has a tongue scraper)\\n\\nThat really help me when I'm out and about and don't have time to brush my teeth or no water source.\\n\\nI always have floss in my backpack/travel toothbrush when there is a bathroom at the restaurant I'm at/water bottle just to rinse my mouth when there's no bathroom around.\\n\\nSoaking my Invisilign with 50/50 hydrogen peroxide and water have been working a lot better for me then denture tablets and haven't had any problem with staining yet.1. Download a tray reminder app to track the time you wear/remove your aligner. Helps me a ton. 2nd. Be patient! It will pay off in the long run! Good luck!Trayminder is the best free app for this in my opinion.I agree, I like it better than the official Invisalign app.I use the calendar on my phone.....Buy some denture cleaning tablets as they are  cheaper than Invisalign cleaning crystals. Soak them in that while you brush your teeth before bed. Will keep them nice and clean. Avoid tumeric as this will stain your trays. First couple days will suck to eat because you will hit your attachments but after that you will get used to it and wont notice anymore.Chew gum when you cant brush if you are out somewhere!!With or without the trays?Without trays, I suggest getting gum that has xylitol as the sweetener. Xylitol is safe for humans and kills dental bacteria. Make sure your pets do not ingest any of the gum.Ya I mean isnt that most gum? But I was wondering if they had trays in. I personally would never do that but thats why I was curiousNo it is not the same for all gum. Most gum either has table sugar in it or another kind generally sorbitol. Table sugar is like fertilizer for dental bacteria. The other sugars are relatively neutral. \\n\\nXylitol acts like a poison to dental bacteria as they think they can use it to make ATP (aka cellular energy) but actually cant. Why do they think they can use it, it is VERY similar molecularly to glucose. So the bacteria spends energy bringing the xylitol into their cell and cant use it. \\n\\nSo while normally gum will clean the chewing surface of your teeth and maybe the side. Xylitol gum will do that and more, it will poison the bacteria in between your gums.\\n\\nEdit: here is a link to an article about xylitol that has research backing it.\\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4232036/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4232036/)Gotcha. I mostly only chew sugar free gum except on occasion but knowing how bad sugared gum is , so thats why I was referring to most gum. Thanks for the info.I wonder why so many trays? Do you have a bad bite?\\n\\nI only ask because my teeth are a lot more crooked than your picture, but I only have 21 trays. My bite is fine though.Yeah, I have TMJd and an overbiteThanks for responding! I always get a little panicky when I see people with a lot more trays than me lolSome people get weekly/bi weekly etcSaw one with 58 the other dayKeep your trays in water when you arent wearing them to avoid them getting cloudy and stinky (and keep them clean - lots of options on this sub for cleaning!). Good luck!I use colgate wisps for on the go brushing. Smoothies for that first week of pain will help tremendously. I got a waterpik for cleaning food out of my teeth that brushing won't get out sometimes. (poppy seeds, flax seed, chia seeds, etc etc.) Buy a mouthwash that's meant for braces. They have special ingredients to help with any painful cuts that will eventually happen.I have never heard of mouthwash for braces but it sounds amazing. My mouth hurts  what kind did you use?Unrelated question as I am also considering Invisalign. What are those bumps that are on the trays? Did they have to do something to your teeth?your ortho will glue some attachment to ur teeth when you are about to start invisalign so trays have also the same formThey help direct your teeth where they're supposed to go, most likely on a slant, or up and down, the tray does a good job moving left and right but hard bring a tooth down with out it. Sometimes called Nubs or Buttons or AttachmentsHey, I just started mine today as well. But I have an underbite. Going to meet a jaw surgeon ( forgot the name) next month as well to discuss surgery to correct my bite because Invisalign cant correct it completely. Good luck!Im on week 3 for my underbite as well, but not getting surgery as I dont think my underbite is severe enough go through with such an invasive surgery!Ahhh, I have a class 3 and decided that its time to fix it. Honestly I am told I look fine etc and I have a big beard that helps hide my bite I feel like. But when I look at pictures taken of my side profile when I did not have a beard it was the worst! Truthfully Im afraid and nervous of the surgery but Im willing to take that risk to hopefully make me more confident for the rest of my life.Every night count that all the connectors on your teeth are still there. I lost one didn't realize, and because the tooth didn't move as much as it should have I had to get my final liner remade, and add an extra four months onto the processWow, thank you for that tip, didn't realize that could lead to extending treatment.My advice is not to eat any sort of Indian curry because your Invisalign will start to glow up in the dark and go AluminousDumb questionyou take trays out to eat, and brush before putting back in, yes? And that still stains them?Try it have some sort of curry with gee brush your teeth use mouth wash if you wish aswell they will still go a yellow/green colour.Every tray feels different.Yes this! Every week is a new fresh hell. Each tray bothers me in some new way.Get a waterpik.Keep in mind that you may develop a posterior open bite, that is a possibility.Id say patience and perseverance pays off. I had a 3 year journey with Invisalign and its the best decision Ive made for myself. Took all the attachments off last week and now just on final refinements. It gets frustrating at times and definitely causes daily inconvenience with F&B, but it also helped me establish better, healthier lifestyle habits and now I have a beautiful smile! Keep it up - youll look back feeling proud of yourself!Good luck!!!! Im currently on my 7th aligner (out of 30)\\n\\nThe first few days will definitely be very irritating and you may want to feel like taking your aligners off.\\n\\nThis is completely normal, and after a week or so you will become very accustomed to your retainers. \\n\\nBelieve it or not, it will eventually come to a point where you like wearing them! Ive become very use to my aligners and I love wearing them.Cold water is your friend! Change trays the night before to sleep off the worst of the new tray feeling (mine was worst at trays 3-4 but after most of them aren't painful, but cold water helps alot with the pain - better than Tylenol). Avoid painkillers if you can, the inflammation actually is part of the process for the first bit, and will help it go faster.\\nBrush your aligners after you brush your teeth but don't use toothpaste, it'll create micro tears in your aligners. Use cold water with your aligners, not hot. When you get your retainers, soaking them in cold water is just as good as denture tablets or any cleaning solution (that's like a 2x a year thing, storing them in cold water regularly eliminates the smell and keeps them fresh). If one of your attachments come off, before making an appointment to get it replaced tell your Ortho which one it was - it may not be a crucial one to replace - when mine came off my Ortho said it was no big deal as long as I tracked properly still, 21 trays later I've had no issue with that tooth.I brush mine with toothpaste. If it's creating tears I can't tell.Exciting! Search this sub for loads of previously shared advice, in addition to what you'll receive here. Tips, advice, new, etc., will bring up hundreds/more? of previous threads and comments.I keep my trays in an old jam jar with a bright red lid as its impossible to lose unlike the Invisalign containers. You can also wash your Invisalign in it with hot water and UNSCENTED dish soap.How long is your treatment plan?Right now Im supposed to change them every 2 weeks but my orthodontist said I might do every 1 week if my teeth shift nicely. So anywhere from 58-116 weeks? HahaWhy not get braces ?I preferred the idea of Invisalign because its easier to clean your teeth after meals, and youre not limited in what you can eat. And popcorn is my absolute favorite food  but also, aesthetics. I would feel self-conscious being an adult with metal braces. Some people fetishize that and it just makes me uncomfyAs someone who also loves popcorn, I have refrained from eating it my entire treatment because of how annoying it is flossing kernels out of my teeth. Eating popcorn regularly again is one of the biggest things I've been looking forward to when I finishI started Invisalign in feb 25, 2022 and my treatment is 18 months and I am on my third tray and when I first started the treatment my orthodontic told me to change my first 8 trays every weekI'm about to start my invisalign. From you picture, my top and bottom teeth look like yours. I will have 18 trays. Did your ortho tell you to eat with your trays in? Mine said Invisalign is now recommending that!Mine said not to eat with them in. But I have heard that, that eating with them in helps them shift your teeth. ·\\x8f»\\x8dï¸\\x8fMy Ortho has me eat and drink with mine in! At this point I think eating without them would feel super weird. I'm only on 4 day changes so they aren't too stained and I never have to worry about wear time or forgetting to put them in because I only take them out to brush.Omg today is my  first day with invisalign also! I think I have 35 trays!Hey! I started mine on Monday. I have 40 trays with weekly changes. The Pul tool with the chewy attached to it really helps me. I am using a tray minder app to make sure I keep them on for 22 hours.Don't get used to forgetting to put them back on after eating. Set an alarm if you have to.I just got mine today too. However, after putting on the attachments, I feel like my teeth are very frosty, most likely due to the procedure. Did this happen to you as well??Yea, should go away after brushing for a couple days I thinkthank you for the reply!! Also did the assistant put them on for you or the orthodontist? How long you have to wear them? I have to wear them for two years \\xadThe orthodontist did the bottom ones and the assistant did the top. Right now Im changing every 2 weeks but I might be able to do every 1 week later. So yea, probably like 2 yearsAre you going to drink soda or orange juice during your treatment? I was told I basically can drink everything as long as I take them off. But I see people say that drinking carbonated drinks are not recommended. What do you think?I bought some reusable straws so I can maybe drink juice with them on still. Im gonna try to not let the liquid hit the trays lol. Im in engineering school so I have an energy drink addiction I'm not a cavity prone person to begin with, but I drink everything with my trays in, and I don't usually use straws. My Ortho didn't tell me to stay away from anything, and it's been 3 months and so far I'm fine. (not a medical professional, your results may vary). I'm a student with adhd so I get the energy drink thing! Just sip some water every few sips and sort of pull the water through your trays if that makes sense, and it should help!Thank you for the advice!! Also I assume we can drink all types of drinks if we take off the trays?Yep as long as you clean your teeth after :)Also I feel like I have trouble pronouncing certain words lol. How do you feel about that? Also biting and eating is a lil uncomfortable feeling my gums and teeth are soreFloss after every meal! Carry like a pouch with floss, disposable toothbrush, your invisalign case & a hook to remove them if you have trouble removing them. Only drink water in them. (Stained them yellow with iced coffee ¬) Goodluck!How much does it cost if you don't mind? My husband and I are considering this to our daughter. Thank you in advance.Mine was $4000 for 2 years of Invisalign and it includes revisions at the end. Most places should let you do monthly payments with no interest.Thank you so much for your honesty. Best of luck!How do you guys do your payments? And did they ask for a source of income?I do a monthly payment of $175. They did not ask for a source of incomeCongrats! Get your Ortho to send you your ClinCheck through the MyInvisalign app. It's a great way to stay motivated to keep them in.Get some interdental brushes, when my teeth started to shift i all of a sudden was getting a lot of stuff stuck in my teeth. I suggest starting with the disposable one as it takes a min for your gums to become acclimated to them and they are more gentle then the reusable kind. Once you dont have issues using them you can switch to the reusable version. I use the same one for a week. I also only use it once a day and use the smallest one possible. There are a ton of great videos on youtube by dentist showing how to use them.I like soaking my trays in peroxide when Im eating. I also use a water pik to œfloss\\x9d after eating. I also only brush with fluoridated toothpaste in the morning and night. The other times, I use a toothpaste with xylitol.Save your first tray for posterity. I would love to look back at my first tray to see how far Ive come!1/ *58* ??!?!.!I know … I have 20 attachments to move my teeth up and down which I think is a lot too?? I have a bad biteFirst of all congratulations on doing this ! Second I did so much research on everything when I first started my invisilign in Oct 2021.\\nYou do not need cleaning tablets save that for your retainers after your treatment. I use a clear liquid soap and a toothbrush to clean my invisilign.  Initially try to not to remove your trays as much as possible for the first few trays to avoid pain. Eat a soft diet if needed. After a few trays the pain and pressure will lessen. Try to brush after every meal but if you cant rinse your mouth and trays and put them back on and clean them as soon as you can. I do wear mine at least 21-22 hrs. a day and I am getting great movement so far. Good luck to you , hang in there you will have a beautiful smile in no time Š!I just brush my trays with whitening toothpaste. Works like a charm and helps get plaque out of the tiny spaces.I did that also , but then started using clear liquid soap it disinfects and cleans, I still do it sometimes. I have 21 attachments - how many do u have? As long as you use a brush when cleaning the trays I think both solutions work well. My orthodontist told me to save the crystals for the retainer that I will have to use after my Invisalign is completed.I have 13 attachments. I had regular braces as a kid and I recently removed my permanent retainer on my bottom teeth. It wasn't glued but attached to metal brackets that wrapped completely around two of my teeth. When that came off there were spaces on either side of both teeth and I was worried about the bottom teeth moving so I decided to get invisible braces, my ortho uses Sparks. I don't actually know what the crystals are, is that invisilign specific? The whitening toothpaste has been awesome, my trays never stain and I even drink beer with them occasionally, (I'm not very cavity prone so it hasn't been a problem).Hi yes Crystals are cleaning crystals made by Invisalign they give a few when you get aligners then you can order them online but if your doing with toothpaste keep it up. Im gonna need permanent retainer on my bottom teeth and a night retainer for my upper teeth- im scheduled for IPR in two weeks , sorta nervous about it  ¬ dont know if your getting IPR ?  I havent drank anything besides water with him but once springtime Ill be out and about and Im sure Ill be drinking the occasional beer \\x8dºI'm going to need a permanent retainer too. I might switch to something better than toothpaate for that since the retainer is going to be around a lot longer. I'll look into these Crystal things. I assume it works for all, but maybe not. \\n\\nI too am going to get IPR on my front bottom teeth. I think four or six of them. I think what makes me nervous about that is them looking unreasonably thin, like they are fake or something. You'll have to let me know how yours turns out. I believe mine are going to be trimmed 0.3 mm on either side. \\n\\nSpring beers. Yay.Make sure you wear them at least 22 hours a day!!  I downloaded the TrayMinder app and it has helped me a lot, especially in the beginning, to keep up with how many hours I wear mine.  Most days I wear them about 23 hours because I only have them out to brush in the morning and then 30 minutes for lunch and 30 minutes for dinner.  I am on a 7 day schedule .  I also rinse my mouth with warm water and salt, to help with any cuts or soreness, it works and its cheap.  I started seeing results (spaces in my teeth) by tray #5!!!!  Good luck, you are going to have an amazing smile ƒMy advice is to be patient. Use trayminder or Invisalign app to track the times your Invisalign is not in your mouth. I keep mine in 22hrs a day and Im making great improvements. I have it off 4 times a day 30 mins at a time breakfast, lunch, snack time & dinner. Total 2 hrs out my mouth. Also when the Invisalign is not in your mouth make sure you have it it your tray. No pockets, no tissue paper. Ive lost mine once and that was a horror story. Good luckI am about to start on this journey, thanks for sharing your feedback OP and others. I just saw the before and after and am excited for the results.  I do not know the trays / steps involved yet, but trying to get pumped about it.  I am more concerned about top teeth, noticeable gaps, my bottom teeth are good overall.I always keep them in baking soda and white vinegar mix when I take them off. It will keep them from getting stained and clear. œ¨Does it hurt?Yes but that means its working! :)How the hell do you need 58 trays?

Ive reconciled myself with the fact that my trays are going to be a neon yellow. I cant keep taking my trays out every time I have to taste food while cooking. Luckily, Im on one week changes and by the time the trays start looking really horrendous, it is time to change.But I can't help but feel like neon green is so stylish and hip... lol!

I wonder if they glow in the dark …Malaysian American here, and having not been able to eat curry for so long has been really grinding my gears lol. I'm on weekly changes myself for my comprehensive plan. Coming close to a year now. I really miss spices and curry. º‘‰‘ˆ\\xadMaybe you could eat whatever you want the day before you change trays? So that way, you can put in new trays the morning after a curry dinner and not worry about stained teeth. Also, it is only turmeric that stains trays as per my experience. You should be fine eating other spices. I cant imagine eating bland food for more than a year. I would rather have kept my messed up teeth than give up spices.I'm going to see about that for sure. Some of my moms recipes has turmeric in it, and I used to use it a lot when I had my dishes. Yeah I was thinking the same when I was on my first lot of 28 trays. I can't wait to be done lmfao! I've also found the Samyang Buldak Bottled Sauce stains my trays for whatever reason, I find that to be odd. \\nFor the first couple of months last year, I had very bland food, eating was hard anyways because of how messed up my teeth were (imo).I just take mine out when I start getting to the point where I need to taste to adjust my cooking. I'll be eating soon anyways, so keeping them out isn't that bad.Just rock the neon color and make it match to your outfit! The only option left ‚It does the same thing to temporary crowns (they're made of acrylic). Had a patient come in, panicking, because she now had a green tooth and didn't want to have it for another two weeks. We made her a new one and told her not to eat turmeric.I love Indian food but I'll only have it on Saturdays now! I change my trays on Sunday nights so I'm hoping a few brushes will prevent this.SMART.i take ginger and tumeric shots and omg i took one with them in once because i was rushing NEVER AGAIN. i wanted to cry for that whole week now ive learned they always come out!Brush your tongue and the roof of your mouth. I learned this trick after staining mine several weeks in a row.Okay a little bit more information. Ive covid and lost my taste and smell so the docter advices this spiced things to trigger my taste. And now my Invisalign is neon green. Didnt think about it, just followed the doctors advice‚Did you eat the spicy food with the trays in though?Nope, I never eat or drink while having them in. Brushed my teeth after and soaked my trays. Drank lots of water before putting them in but it didnt work‚This happens to my tray after a katsu curry. Even after I brush my teeth. (Not that bright a yellow though)That is crazy!!!!!Yeah, butttt lesson learned! Never eat or drink something like this anymore while having Invisalign.Was it turmeric or something else.. need to know what to avoid :)this happened to me with kale chips, fyi.I had the exact same thing happen with turmeric, so definitely avoid thatTry soaking your trays in hydrogen peroxide.WATCH OUT, RADIO ACTIVE MAN!Watch OUT Radio... active MAN.Dont sweat it, as long as your teeth didnt get stained! Youll switch to a new tray soon. \\nMy concern is your Covid infection. Are you ok? Are people in contact with you ok?Thanks for your concerns! Im okay right now, I was very sick.

It feels so good to be able to SMILE with my teeth and not worry at all about what people think about my chompers What did it cost you?I make monthly payments but the total cost they gave me is around $6500. I was shocked when they told me that and almost didnt go through with it but Im glad I didYoure are beautiful no matter what. Im glad it makes you happy. Best of luck!That seems to the norm for what I see for the œcomprehensive\\x9d plan mine was $4800 for a round of up to 40 trays and 1 refinementa beautiful before and a beautiful after!People have actually said to me œWho notices teeth?!\\x9d I go œOh, believe me, I can tell what kind of bite you have also just by how you smile.\\x9dScrolling past.. wow great results. What is the general price and time frame for something like this?I pay monthly but my total cost is somewhere around $6500. Ive been wearing them since August 4th so about 8 months so far. Not sure how long Ill be in refinementsThanks!!How long did this take you? You look amazing!The left picture is a couple years old but Ive been wearing the Invisalign almost exactly 8 monthsAmazing!!It is definitely a great result and Im sorry to hear people treated you differently beforehand.  It just shows how some people can be superficial which is there loss in the long term.   Keep smiling because you look great ‘\\x8d\\x8f½Looks amazing!!!Your transformation looks great! Its almost been a year for me and im on my last set 19/26. I feel great not having a huge gap in my front teeth. Ill have to get lifetime retainers but Im ok with that. Also, Ill have to get a molar implant so that I have a full set of teeth. Congrats!Im already planning on having permanent retainers put in instead of using the clear ones. My teeth crave freedom from their invisible prisonOmg I'm sorry I just lost my shit at that... I might put it on a t shirt... I'm on tray 30 and some of my teeth have shifted back a bit forming these bigger gaps. Wish I had a progress like thisDont get discouraged because itll be so worth it soon! My back teeth have bigger gaps than Im used to (good gets stuck in there a lot) and my bite is slightly open in the back so even though it looks good now I still have a little ways to go. ‘\\x8dWow that looks great!! Im on tray 17 and still probably have a year to go. I got it for my overbite but havent seen much change yet. Not sure if anyone else has this issueI didnt start seeing jaw-dropping changes until maybe tray 25 but I didnt have an overbite so everyones case will be differentCan I ask how long it took for your misplaced canine to descend? I have the same issue, and I have 77 trays for the first part of my treatment- there are other issues as well, but the canine is the most dramatic for me.Yep my one snaggletooth was the biggest thing I wanted to fix. My bottom teeth were all very crooked and crowded but my smile doesnt show my bottom teeth so the canine was the biggest deal for me. \\n\\nIts been very gradual but started moving immediately. There was noticeable improvement within 2 months (weekly tray changes, so 8 trays) and it was completely inline by tray 27. I know that sounds like forever if you just started but it really flew by.Do people really treat you differently based on your teeth? People have always told me I am hot/pretty but I have an overbite and my canines are twisted forward. At my last job I was bullied and ignored and ostracized. I could never tell if it was because they were jealous of me or if I unknowingly smelled bad or of it was how I dress/ look. I never really felt it was a teeth thing but who knows. I guess we will see if I notice people treating me differently after the invisalign. I wonder if your confidence could have gone up after too from having straight teeth which could also affect how people treat you. Its hard to believe people would be so shallow as to treat you bad for your teeth but there are some real assholes out there so I believe you.I never felt like anyone treated me badly because my teeth were crooked. I did have rude comments made about my teeth on occasion but I never felt like I was bullied because of my teeth (as an adult. Kids bully other kids for anything so Im not counting childhood).  \\n\\nThere was one instance I ran into someone from my parents church at the store and I said hello - her school aged kid said, loudly œwhats wrong with your teeth??\\x9d The disparaging jokes others like to make about crooked teeth on social media were always hurtful too. Like for example when Cardi B was first starting out I saw a lot of people clown on her teeth (before she got veneers) and it did hurt because mine were more crooked than hers ever were. \\n\\nI have noticed a feeling that strangers are generally friendlier to me now or want to speak to me for longer than before. Im married and have been with my husband for 5 years, since I was 20, so I didnt date around a lot as an adult. So I didnt experience the rejection that I imagine other people who have crooked teeth might experience when trying to date. \\n\\nMostly the improvements have been to my confidence. ‚ok i am really worried about wobbly teeth did u have wobbly teeth during ur treatment? and how wobbly is it? like can u visibly see the wobble? im worried cuz i keep pushing my teeth all the time and i cant control the urge to leave it alone to tighten back up so i dont know im really worried tbhAlmost all my teeth are still slightly wobbly and I can see the wobble if I look very closely. Its a very slight looseness, like a fraction of a centimeters worth of movement. Im pretty sure they will stop being loose when we get our retainers and the teeth have time to settle in place. They are moving at a pretty rapid pace so it only makes sense that theyd be loose.did you have any attachments???I have 19 attachmentsI can't imagine why anybody who visits this sub would need to be convinced that invisalign would straighten out their teeth.A lot of people post to ask if its worth it or if theyre a candidate for InvisalignWell this post certainly wouldnt answer whether they are candidates for it. And whether they think its worth it will be based on how much value they place on having straighter teeth. So that isnt really answered by this post either.CoolWhich part are you saying is cool?while the ortho changes your teeth your opto changes your eyes, looks good.Very nice, you look like a totally different person.\", 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'financial concerns', 'oral hygiene', 'facial appearance', 'tray time management', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns'], 'scores': [0.2526928186416626, 0.1492326259613037, 0.139182910323143, 0.12591402232646942, 0.12094131112098694, 0.11815215647220612, 0.09388413280248642]}, {'sequence': 'Wear your retainers after Invisalign100%!

(i.e., are new retainers covered under the comprehensive plan)?It depends on your contract. Mine I paid to include them, it was a slight up charge at my ortho. However, after traditional braces I didnt have it and paid $500 each time. Id highly recommend asking and seeing if they will let you add it if it doesnt come included, it easily pays for itselfI was given 4 sets of retainers when I was finished. Its been about 15 months and I still am using my first setI only had to replace mine every few years, it is recommended as you dont always notice them stretching out. Mine I mostly broke before 3 years hit, but I also didnt get these cause of not wearing my retainers but rather to finish what I never did with my braces. My teeth never shifted in the 12 years between!Ok. Good to know. Thank youHi all.\\nI finished Invisalign last year Aug. 2021. So Ive been Invisalign-free for nine months now and Im still happy with the results. This is just a friendly reminder to everyone that even after Invisalign or braces, please remember to wear your night-time retainers. Dont let all that time and money go to waste for a temporary smile. Retainers really are a life long commitment.Congratulations! And what a beautiful smile!Thank you so much!Retainers are a life long commitment. \\nDoes it mean you have to wear the retainer forever ?It does, or until you want your teeth to move back. First 20-22 hours a day (my ortho says for a year but Ive seen others being recommended less) so the teeth can set in their new place, then night time wear for the rest of your life.I dont mind this. Invis helped cut down nighttime snacking to zero for me and Ive lost 15 lbs without working out cause of that. If nighttime retainers help keep my teeth straight and extra pounds off, count me in lmaoThis is what Im looking forward to.  I get my aligners in two weeks my horrible habit is the godawful late night snacks!  So if it can help me cut that down Im all for it lol.  I have no self controlWow, I thought you are done when you are doneAbsolutely not. Half the stories in here are people who had braces as a kid and didn\\'t wear their retainer after.Correct. I had braces and wore my retainer for years, but then as an adult just kind of trailed off and stopped. That\\'s why I\\'m now having to do Invisalign to repair the shifting my teeth have done back to where they were prior to my braces. Moral of the story: Always wear your retainer.\\n\\nThe good news for me is that I need a night guard for grinding, and the retainer will do double-duty, so I\\'m happy with it.Hi, we are twins. Orthodontic twins, at least. Same exact story here and I plan to wear my retainers in lieu of my night guardforever!No, even the Invisalign site itself tells you you\\'ll have to wear a retainer or your teeth will revert back to their original state. In fact, go to the Invisalign site and look at the section where it discusses \"Retainers\". It gives you the specific schedule you can expect to have to wear your retainer. It\\'s very helpful.Thats the dream Same for regular braces too of thats any consolation.Right? I am so surprised to read that I have to wear the same damn thing for the rest of my life...Mine says my last liner is 6 weeks. I dont know about my retainer yet.Does anyone know what Invisalign retainers are made from? It was a concern when I started that having plastic in my mouth could not be good for my health. Now realizing it will be a life long thing, Im wondering if this could have health effects?Basically. My ortho told me that no matter how much time has passed, your teeth naturally wants to go back to its original state.Yeah because teeth are just bones in a bit of flesh that are in that position because of the forces of your bite. Teeth will never go in exactly the same position, but they\\'ll go in approximately the same position because all the forces that made them go into that position are still there. But for example after a jaw surgery teeth might naturally move into different positions.Great post! I wanted to ask how it\\'s been post treatment.    \\nHow compliant were you during treatment?    \\nHow compliant are you post treatment ie are you wearing them every single night or have you skipped or anything else?     \\nHave your teeth moved since you stoped wearing aligners and are now on nightly.Hi. For the first week or so it felt weird to not have my aligners on during the day since treatment. I wore my retainers every night recommended by my ortho and I havent missed a night since. I also havent noticed any shift in my teeth.Make sure to get your retainer replaced if it has cracks!!! I just went back to my final last tray (from December) only to find out my teeth shifted. Retainers  dont retain when they have cracks.Yes, absolutely!how long did it last you?It lasted me about 5 months. All the time wear. Maybe I wasnt careful enough taking them out? I think mine also had an interesting fit on my back molars making it a bit difficult to get in and out. Im going to have them put in a lingual bar next week. Everyone in my family had insane bottom teeth crowding. I want to do what it takes to preserve this. I love straight so much! Easier to clean and bite feels so healthy.yeah ive wondered how long to expect them to last when youre wearing the first one full time for so long. i feel you about the bottom teeth crowding - my bottom 4 werent too pretty before but yes straight is SO nice and easier to clean!They last about a year or so.Why dont just put a permanent wire behind your teeth ? Im halfway through my Invisalign process and the wire is something that is included in my treatment, like a standard stepAlong with my night retainers, I do have permanent wires of my bottom 6 teeth. This was an additional option after my treatment. I dont have it behind my top teeth because when I bite down, my teeth are very close to one another, so most likely it would cause the retainer to come off.Now I\\'m nervous that maybe a wire is included in mine and I wasn\\'t told. Lol I very much do not want one, even though I would be a candidate due to crowding. I\\'m 100% fine with wearing my retainers forever. Lol I hope they don\\'t mind if I refuse.Usually the wire is optional, so you can refuse it if you dont want it. The night retainers are a a must though. Get you orthos feedback first based on your case. Also,  ask your ortho that if you do end up getting the wires, but dont end up liking it or find it to be a hassle, you can get it removed and just stick to night retainers.Awesome,  thanks!I\\'m curious.  Do the retainers help with teeth grinding or protect your teeth if you\\'re a teeth clencher or grinder at night?\\n\\nI\\'m mainly doing Invisalign due to TMJ and incorrect teeth alignment that affects my bite and jaw.Invisalign can help. But, you can request custom made night guards for your tmj if you don\\'t want to go through the Invisalign process at your dentist. \\n\\nPersonally, one of the main reason that I did Invisalign was to slightly alleviate the teeth grinding caused by my overbite and of course to have straighter teeth.. I still have TMJ but, it\\'s not as bad as before I did Invisalign. \\n\\nIn my orthodontist office, they had the option to make my plastic retainer thicker than normal ones to help with the grinding.That\\'s why I\\'m doing it.  The custom made night guard would only help with teeth grinding, not fix my bite or align my teeth properly.\\n\\nI\\'m at #7 of 48.  Not too bad so far.Beautiful smileHonestly after being on Invisalign for 3 years, Im so used to wearing them that I cant sleep without my retainers in lolIm ignoring my last (childhood) ortho doing things myself this time around and *gradually* decreasing the amount of time from 24/7 wear to nights only. I took retainer out for 2 hours when they gave me the all clear to only wear them at night and I never got the retainer back in again I went back to the ortho and they said oh teeth shift, its normal, itll be fine. You dont need any additional treatment. Went back to the same orthodontist 7 years later, they said the same thing. \\n\\nSeveral years of painful chipping, enamel wearing, cavities, cheek biting, maxillary sinus and Eustachian tube issues amongst others later, my teeth are still fine. I went to multiple dental hospitals (you have to line up outside at 6 am for hours for the chance of treatment) begging for help. They insisted any orthodontic work would purely be cosmetic despite me telling them about the headaches and difficulty chewing so bad I end up with aspiration pneumonia from inhaling food which is something old people get.\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/uO6eJZd\\n\\nYeah no. Lower right premolars are practically horizontal and chipping the shit out of the upper row. Incisors are totally unusable. I havent bitten into a whole fruit (even soft ones like peaches) or even though the layers of sandwich in well over a decade. The fuck do you mean it would be purely cosmetic, I am not functioning.\\n\\nI was homeless for a few years but after getting my place now and saving like crazy being on disability, I actually have the time and money to try this one more time and without additional complications of doing the treatment whilst juggling going to work/school. Im already struggling with eating disorder relapse and the pain as it is, so Id be even less inclined to eat if I wasnt largely at home and couldnt take the time I need taking them out/cleaning them/putting them back in.\\n\\nI am being being so so careful knowing how fast my teeth like to move and suspect I have a hypermobility spectrum disorder or connective tissue disorder nowCan confirm. Went without my retainers for 6 days, came home, they didnt fit. Teeth moved. Back again doing another 17 trays \\xadAfter 6 days?! No way! ”So sorry to hear.

Im in this predicament because I didnt where my retainers after braces. But my buddy ended up with a wire, 22 years later his teeth are still perfect and Im back in orthodontics. Round 2 as an adult is a munch more serious undertaking for my especially because of the money , so he can either bond a wire in or Im telling him to kick rocks and finding someone who will.I have permanent wires to cover all front teeth, top and bottom. I do wear my night retainer 99% of the time, but it\\'s nice to know my teeth won\\'t shift that much when I forget the other 1% of the time.Oh wow. The wire retainers should have been an option for you and definitely covered! ”I have permanent retainers along with night retainers and I didnt have to pay extra for either one at the end of my treatment because it was covered. The permanent retainers are only on my bottom 6 teeth and this was an option for me because my ortho told me that flossing might be a little annoying.Damn, my ortho had to take off my permanent bottom wire that I had since I was in middle school (17 years? And I was lucky that it never popped out). I wish I had one on my top front teeth because thats the ones that shifted that Im trying to fix now ;/The wire alone isnt enough since it only covers a few teeth. Wire + plastic retainer combo is good for preventing relapse.Wire alone is more than enough of its installed from first molar to first molar.Interesting. Ive never heard of a wire that extends from molar to molar. Usually just the middle few.After braces, my husband has a wire on some of his teeth - and was recommended braces, not invisilign, braces.Can you get a permanent retainer (metal attachment behind teeth) and a clear retainer at the same time or is it one or the other?You can get both. And the clear retainer is especially necessary if the wire does not span across all your teeth.amazing teeth! were you told to only wear them at night? I\\'m starting to freak out about the fact that I\\'ve heard that people are \"finished\" and then are told to wear their retainer for 20 hours a day. this is just so disheartening for me, so I\\'m interested to hear what your ortho saidThank you! --Yes, for my case my ortho told me to wear my retainers overnight.Very trueGorgeousMy ortho is preferring that i get the steel wire on the top and bottom of my teeth in lieu of retainers.\\n\\nHonestly from this sub it seems like 50/50 but what do you suggest? should i request retainers instead? my mates all say the steel wire is easier because you can just forget about it.I would say def get the permanent retainers but ALSO get a clear retainer afterwards in case ur molars (or rther teeth that aren\\'t on the wire ) start shifting, and pushing the wired teeth forward or smthg like that. You never know 20 years from now if ur teeth start shifting and cause u pain. I think better be safe than sorry. \\n\\nAnd if they say u don\\'t really need both (but u wanna do both) ADVOCATE FOR IT ANYWAY.Yea good idea personally i dont mind night time retainers ive gotten used to this with invisalign anyway so theres no issue with me continuing until the day i dieI do get itmust wear retainer. I had braces as a teen, gave up the retainer after 5 years or so and teeth slowly shifted. Fast forward another 5 years and theres be no way the retainer would have kept my teeth where they were, looking at the retainer my teeth have changed shape, as in grew. Potentially my teeth werent ready for braces as a teen. Something as a parent I will be thinking about. Teeth arent fully in the position they will be as an adult when youre a teen. Im glad though. I wouldnt want my teeth to stayed looking like my teen teeth - the teeth and arch are tiny and look like a child.  My kids will need braces but Im expecting Ill put them in braces and set their expeditions that they will likely get them aligned again as an adult.I understand. I started Invisalign in my mid 20s and even though I thought I was late in the game, my ortho reminded me that I have adult teeth and they were all in position compared to teen teeth.On day 3 of 1 out of 19 trays. Life is a bit miserable to be honest. This sub lifts my spirits a bit.You got this!

I was once in your shoes. Tray #12 of 13.. I\\'m sure I\\'ll definitely get refinements bc my slight overbite is not corrected yetBeautiful smile. \\n\\nThats one of the reasons why Im on the fence with getting Invisalign. Im in my 30s and I cant imagine that I would have to wear retainers for the next 40 years its just seems like such a big commitment and a chore. I was honestly ready to go with it after my consultation but retainer situation personally for me was a huge dealYour teeth look beautiful. I had my treatment 5 years ago. Yes, make sure to wear that retainer. I also recommend getting a backup retainer. I ordered mine from these guys. [https://www.sportingsmiles.com/teeth-retainers.html](https://www.sportingsmiles.com/teeth-retainers.html) I ordered when I wasn\\'t in a rush so I could try them out and was very happy with the retainer.

To get the top aligner off: take your RIGHT thumb with nail facing the ceiling. Reach into the inside of the tray across to the LEFT side and reach near the back. Hook your thumbnail on the ridge at the side of the last tooth and pull down. It should unhook and you can gently pull it down and off the rest.\\n\\n2. To get the bottom aligner off: take your RIGHT thumb, face your nail to the floor. Reach into your mouth on the outside of the tray on the RIGHT. Hook your thumbnail onto the ridge of the side of the back tooth and pull up until it unhooks and you can gently pull it up off the rest of the teeth.Thank you for your description! I just tried it and it works.  Up till now (tray 3), the only way I could get them off was with the hook.  Much appreciated!Glad to help! I have the hook pull tool as well but found it to be harder to use than my thumbnail method (and Id often hurt my gums using it), so I stopped using it.I can\\'t believe you didn\\'t lose a single one.\\n\\nI\\'ve lost 5 and it\\'s my first week.

Never had issues and still am cavity free. \\x81Ive avoided eating out for this reason ‚Eating on an airplane, was the first and only time I ate leaving my trays inI fly weekly for work.  Travel water flosser in the lavatory after meal service is the way to go.Just had food poisoning. Instances such as that when I had to remove my retainers in 2.5 seconds before I threw up my guts :)I had to do this last night (recently became pregt and am dying). I ended up not being quick enough for the second round and had to wash my trays with dishsoap.Oh god that sounds miserable ƒOh man! This! I has terrible food poisoning two weeks ago and threw up a bunch with my trays and elastics on cause I was just not quick enough. So disgustingRushing to eat my meals and end up having shrimp and chocolate cake in my mouth all at once.  Having gross combinations of food I\\'ve never imagined tasting because there\\'s no breaks between foods during meals.Yes! The different food combinations ‚Attachments suck* The lisp\\n* Hassle when eating out (I\\'m a germaphobe)\\n* Since I love to try new recipes it\\'s annoying that I can\\'t taste test whatever I\\'m making as I\\'m making it\\n* Teeth feel more sensitive\\n* Simply having to floss and brush after every meal\\n* I could go on tbh>Since I love to try new recipes it\\'s annoying that I can\\'t taste test whatever I\\'m making as I\\'m making it\\n\\nYes. Worst thing is trying to see if pasta is cooked. I\\'ve tried with my aligners in and it\\'s hard to tell. Not to mention checking for seasoning!Speaking is almost worst of them all, i cannot speak as i used to with them on.\\n\\ni\\'ve had them for 8d nowSpeaking is very hard.I think it will probably improve if youve only had them in for a week. I was self-conscious about that for the first 2 weeks but on week 7/8 now and virtually no lisp or speaking issues.I had a expander for 4 months before Invisalign and I had a lisp so I think that helped with the trays because luckily I never got one with the traysThe feeling of foreign plastic things in my mouth is my least favorite part. But I have bite ramps and suspect it would be much less annoying without them. \\n\\nI never rush with meals and I dont brush any more than I ever have. Ive had zero pain. Trays are easy to remove. My orthodontist is SO much fun to talk to. My teeth are starting to look almost perfect and Im smiling a lot more. Just the weird plastic-in-my-mouth part wears on me.ugh this, if i think about it too much i start gagging. ive also always been a grazer vs eating regular meals and i cant wait to go back to eating how my body wants toYeah I get that completely! Besides feeling rushed with meals its all really easy, I thought there would be pain with every new set but theres not. Only pain was with set one but Im cruising right a long just fine \\x8f\\x8f¼I\\'m glad to hear that not having \"new tray pain\"  is normal!Yeah personally I havent but a few people say they doits so funny how accustomed I am to the œforeign plastic\\x9d feeling now after about 18/22 trays with bite ramps. when my trays are out, i actually dont like it because it feels SO weird and my teeth feel so small and fragile without the trays now hahaIm due to get bite ramps in a few trays. What do they actually do? I dont really understand what they do that the actual tray (without them) cant do? ”I had them, they just use your front teeth to keep the back and middle teeth off of eachother so they can move, as they give your bite a new resting placeThanksThis gives me hope lol this subreddit can make the whole process seem like a horror show sometimes. Idgaf in reality though anything is worth not hating my smile.I agree with the feeling of them being in your mouth. My first impression was that they felt much more noticeable and thick then I was expecting. I have a hard time not clenching because I get uncomfortable with them all the time.The aligners can stink if you dont wash them.\\n\\nI really don\\'t have any substantial complaints.  I find it pretty easy.I soak mine with a cleaner tablet from Pul once a day, that stops the smell and keeps the aligners super clean without having to brush them.This is what I do as well. Im on tray 2. The ortho told me to just brush with leftover toothpaste and my first set discolored. For this set, I drop it in retainer cleaner while Im eating dinner. Then I brush, rinse the retainers, and put them back in. They feel and smell better without discoloration that the first set had.Totally! I tried brushing them for a few weeks and it just wasnt enough to stop them from discoloring.My dentist said to just rinse the aligners with water. After 2 days they get so gross. I now clean then with my toothbrush and some mild soap, as others here have suggested.\\n\\nBut everyone should clean them every 2-3 days.The buttons for elastics.\\n I can\\'t eat ramen or stringy food without risking it getting hooked on the buttons while I swallow. It is the worst feeling of the world. Especially in public where you can\\'t just put your finger in your mouth to unhook it.That I didn\\'t start years ago[deleted]Oh god... halfway through my treatment, I needed wisdom teeth pulled.  My trays had pooled blood in them for 3 weeks.  In the morning, I seriously looked like a horror movie extra.Oh god I cant imagine dealing with wisdom teeth extraction AND Invisalign!!! You poor soul! Thats fucking awful!!!I feel like I have a binge eating disorder now because after dinner I always eat a snack too, since I don\\'t want to have to take my aligners out again at night.Yeah after my meals Im usually extremely full because I know I have to wait hours to eat againYeah I basically call it a binge cuz I eat once a day. Its kind of funny, I lay out everything Im gonna eat on the counter then remove my aligners and dig in. Meal, fruit, vegetables, dessert, chai, water. I need to grocery shop for less now which I guess is goodThat... that is something new but seems effecient :pIt is, cuz it takes me like 10 minutes or so to clean my teeth and aligners each time (just to my satisfaction) and I cant just do that multiple times a day unless absolutely necessaryFor me it would be having to turn down snacks. I used to feel the need to give the whole invisalign spiel but now I just say no thank you bc it\\'s way easier …Yeah I agree ‚I will admit though there have been times where I\\'ve given in hahahaIm with the people saying rushing meals. I love to take time eating a tapas style meal that can take well over an hour (and then some). So that sucks.The discoloured teeth that apparently come as standard but that werent mentioned either.I have the same issue Are you talking about the discoloration that develops around the glue where attachments are? Either way, same. Sigh.Its more general than that, and awful where there are gaps inbetween teeth.  I saw the hygienist this week and she said it comes as standard with Invisalign.  •Not drinking hot drinks! Ill add some ice cubes to my plain, black coffee and drink it out of a straw with my retainers in. I also love tea but thats something I refuse to have lukewarm. So I either have to chug it with lunch (ouch) or just skip it entirely. I cant wait to be able to drink HOT coffee again!I seriously miss my leisure day off mornings taking hours to finish a lot of coffeethose were the best. Now I brew a pot and try to quickly drink it, I usually make it about halfway through before brushing my teeth and popping the aligners in again.Currently, the waiting when only back teeth are moving and I don\\'t see any changes for weeks and thinking about the fact that it will take another 6 months to finish first round and who knows how much time after.\\n\\nI really had a lot of motivation and was all excited when I was able to see the teeth moving every week (bottom ones) and nothing bothered me. Now when I don\\'t see any changes, I feel like I don\\'t have any motivation and it annoys me (Invisalign annoys me, cleaning annoys me, not being able to eat snacks whenever I want annoys me, and the fact that I know what is going on and that it is all in my head and still feel unmotivated also annoys me).Refinements, the site or orthodontist says a small amount people may need refinements, yet its basically every person on this sub needing themAnyone who says refinements are for a \\'small\\' amount of people is being *incredibly* misleading. In reality the inverse is true; refinements are mostly guaranteed and only a small number of people don\\'t get them.\\n\\nI knew that because I did my research, but SHOCKINGLY, my provider didn\\'t really mention it either until I brought it up. So shady.Ill definitely be a chronic clencher after thisWearing my aligners at night FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. Why the f dont they explain that to you before they glue those awful shark teeth on your teeth, which they didnt warn me about either.Shark teeth? Could you please explain to me what that is? Im on tray 18 of 25 rn so nearing completionIm gonna guess the buttons (aka attachments) ? The buttons or attachments. I didnt know they were getting out on until they were literally getting put on and afterwards I felt like I looked like a freak. I was devastated.Thanks for your reply. Also; are the attachments for life??! I thouht they would just be taken off at the end of treatment and that youd get some new aligners for during the night which dont need attachments?The aligners are for life. My attachments were removed.Wait what!?! You have to wear the aligners after your treatment is over? \\n\\nNO ONE TOLD ME THIS.Yeah, generally a 24/7 retainer for 6mo after treatment, then every night for the rest of your life so your teeth don\\'t get crazy and shift back over time.Well, I guess Ill just have to deal. I would have chosen to do the treatment regardless, but theres a lot I didnt know going into it.I feel you... I wasn\\'t aware myself until I had already made the ficial commitment. I\\'m still on refinements and have yet to get to the \"after-treatment retainer\" stage, but I\\'m not looking forward to it haha.If they had told me I had to wear the aligners every night forever, I wouldnt have done it in the first place. I only had a few crooked teeth on the bottom and otherwise my teeth looked great when I smiled. Now Im worried if I stop wearing the aligners they will look even worse than they did before.Frankly same. I mean I did know about wearing retainers, that\\'s true for invisalign and braces. But my teeth were mostly fine and it\\'s not really worth it if I\\'m being honest lol.   \\n\\n\\nI can totally see it being 100% worth and life-changing if you have more major issues to correct, but a year in and $5.5K down, I don\\'t think I would recommend it to anyone else with minor cosmetic issues in their smile. I do like my new smile. But...eh.But..eh seriously. Now we are stuck and probably also need to replace the aligners at some point for not cheap. At least they double as trays for teeth whiteningMy ortho told me you can skip nights. He said most people keep them on every night because they dont want their teeth to shift back (I mean you do pay money to make them straight). But he told me you dont have to wear them nightly. But the retainer for 6 months is because your teeth will still be loose and they need to make sure they wont shift on you. The retainer they showed me looked super thin and invisible, not sure what yours will look like but my ortho said they are very comfortable.The nightly aligners are the same as the last aligned you wear. They arent comfortable unless you like having those things in your mouth. Generally there is no pain but if you skip a night your teeth do move and the retainer moves them back the next day so its more unpleasant to skip a night because you feel the pressure of them moving back. Of course they told you it was comfortable.Right now my biggest complaint is the awful lisp I have. Didn\\'t have it before my bite ramps appeared and I\\'ve had bite ramps for the past 6 or 7 trays so it\\'s not going anywhere. It\\'s so embarrassing. Before that my biggest complaint was always having my \"out time\" on my mind. I never really felt rushed eating but I usually like to sit and relax for a little while after dinner and having to constantly be aware of how long it\\'s been since I took the trays out was/is stressful.Entirely this. I\\'ve had them since late Dec and the lisp is not going anywhere. I\\'m so sick of it! And same with meals; I don\\'t rush them but I always get sad when I then have to count down the remaining time I have with my blissfully free teeth before putting the trays back in.I have had bite ramps since the beginning and the lisp went away after about 8 weeks, so theres hope.That\\'s good to know! I only have 2 trays left after the ones I\\'m on but I\\'m getting refinements so I hope either the bite ramps go away or the lisp does.Good luck! I sincerely hate bite ramps!Thanks! Good luck to you too!Not being able to snack easily. I have IBS and usually manage it by grazing on small meals during the day rather than 3 big ones, so going back to shovelling food in 3 sittings has been awful. Counting down the days until it\\'s overI get this so much on a medical level too, I used to have an eating disorder and feeling full is something I loathe and can be a bit triggering.Taking way longer than expected. Having to wait weeks for new trays after scan.I\\'m almost to this phase (end of my first round) and I am dreading wearing the same crusty tray for like 5 weeks until the refinements come in. There HAS to be a better way.   \\n\\n\\nI\\'ve only ever seen one person say they got \\'dummy\\' trays that were the same as their final tray for that waiting period. That should be standard!My doc not explaining that one side of my mouth is crossbite and cant be corrected any further. 20 trays in.Ouch! Why are they so uncommunicative?!I\\'m very curious about this because I got talked into doing invisalign by my dentist *because*  of my crossbite. To fix it. ´Coming from a foodie I cannot believe how much I miss leisurely eating a good meal. The mouth feel is seriously interrupted by attachments on every tooth minus incisors. Im more concerned with trying to make sure food isnt getting stuck around the elastic button attachments on my molars than savoring my food (flavor, texture, etc) which makes me really sad.  \\n\\n2nd place complaint is how much my jaw is hurting as my deep bite is adjusted (bite ramps and elastics). I have debated botox for the last week because I am waking up with headaches that are near blinding because of the jaw clenching. I am a month into a 2 year treatment plan. I almost laughed when my ortho recommended lavender oil and ice packs bless his holistic heart! food stuck in my teethOMG! Way more food gets stuck now!Yes! Our tongue cant clean as well with the damn attachments in the way!!I can never snack anymore, i dont even eat out a restaurants i just take it home and eat. Thats really it i now like to flossConstantly feeling like Im failing.  Had the trays in 20 hours?  Failed.  Had them in 16 hours?  DEFINITELY failed.  Even though I had the things in my mouth twice as much as I didnt.People who have partners, hows kissing? Im not kissing anyone right now but the amount of saliva I have to try to control seems like it would be hard for spontaneous kissing.I don\\'t find kissing to be too different except for biting. I leave my trays in and it\\'s really not a pain or anything. I was removing my elastics but decided not to last time amd even that wasn\\'t in the wayI kissed my ex boyfriend last night and had the aligners in. He didnt say anything about it being odd.My partner and I both got Invisalign at the same time. \\n\\nThe amount of open mouth kisses has gone way down, especially on day 6 of wear.I just snorted lol thats funny. Makes sense though!!I feel like the attachments might slice them up! Or if I have the trays in, there just isn\\'t any room! LoLGagging all day bc I have plastic in my mouth lolI never really rushed through meals. I think it was the brushing and brushing and brushing. Compared to when I had braces, I felt like Invisalign was a cakewalkIm someone who is real literal so when they say 22 hours a day I make it 22 hours a day ‚ it doesnt make it easier that Im pretty big in lifting weights so when I eat my meals are usually pretty big. After eating I have a short window to do my brushing regimentIt is 20-22 hoursYeah I know but go big or go homeLinea Alba!!!! Started only on my cheeks but now its on my upper lip and it is annoying and painful. Also the chapped lips and the dry mouth. And waking up every morning with a sore throat. TBH I kind of hate everything and am so happy to be on to the next phase in 10 days!!! Bring on the retainers!I came here to complain about these exact things. The lines on my cheeks, my tongue and now with the attachments, my upper lip. Also my mouth is always so dry no matter how much I drink water. I\\'d also add no one told me about the attachments and how rough they\\'d be. It\\'s been a few weeks, so it\\'s getting better, but they are still pretty scratchy.Is that what it\\'s called?!! Ugh, hate it! And I get sores on my tongue every time I change trays! Like I\\'m allergic to the plastic or something. 8 more to go. Can\\'t wait!!Yea I learned the term somewhere on this sub.I use a lot of chap stick and sugar free mints with the dry mouth \\x8f\\x8f¼Honestly, I\\'ve somewhat given up on enjoying food. Food (for my next 6 months) will be for sustece and post-gym recovery.\\nI\\'m not really interested in eating nice or expensive food, at least until my Invisalign attachments are removed.Refinement phase doesn\\'t work. Did my first 45 trays and tried doing refinements to close the gaps between my upper and lower teeth. Got assigned another 40 trays which ended up putting so much pressure on my canines and widened the gaps between my teeth, so we had to do another scan. Ended upwith another 35 trays, the gaps between my teeth still didn\\'t close back up. So I\\'m on metal braces instead -.-I would say the smell ugh no matter how careful I am after a week they just have this smell to them ( and the box) which is SO ANNOYING I hate it so much ’Honestly not much. Maybe just how much brushing I do? The cost is worth it to love myself. The discomfort is expected.. I dont rush eating my meals, bc Im kinda a fast Eater anyway.. maybe just the fear of cavities from cheating here and thereWhen you say cheating what do you mean?Drinking with them in hahaI could easily complain about everything I\\'ve read here and then some. Be aware that you will likely have the hassle and discomfort of attachments, buttons, elastics etc.  You will hate eating. You will have setbacks. It will take way longer than you anticipated (I have had well over 100 trays). And something I haven\\'t seen mentioned here...it can change the shape of your face SIGNIFICANTLY!!! I have developed muscular hypertrophy in my masseter and temporal muscles to go along with my ever-changing bite.  I regret starting this process   and there does not seem to be an end in sight. I hate smiling more than ever...I look like a monkey and it is very unatural feeling. Despite the drop of mask mandates, I want to wear one forever. Please note I have used the words can/may/likely. This is not everyone\\'s experience. Just try to know as much as possible beforehand so you are not caught off guard or disappointed. Good luck. \\nPhew, felt good to rant! Thank you!In know its an expense but they have masseter botox that really helps with the hypertrophy!!I will definitely be looking into it!That I need to take the trays out to eat always feels more comfortable with them in!The country Im living still has rules to put the mask on. Its hard to remove Invisalign when eating out The hooks if you also have elastics. If I don\\'t shave off the sharp parts, it always scrapes my mouth and I hate talkingThat some trays are super rigid and stick out and cut up my tongueThe relentless TMJ that started after beginning treatment :(I got invisalign for my tmj problems but it made it worse because the urge to bite down stresses the tmj even more out ,it cost me 170euros to switch to bracesEating out is kinda akward but not too bad, my main complaint is when I have it in it makes like lips looks weird, Like they protrude a little bit idkI am a really slow eater and a snacker but the transition wasn\\'t super difficult. I pretty much hit 22 hrs each day. I had my first outing where there wasn\\'t really an accessible clean bathroom (monster truck show at a dirt track) and I just used hand sanitizer before touching my mouth and swished my mouth with water before putting my trays back in. I brushed my teeth and trays a few hrs later when I got home.\\n\\nFor me, my issues are trying not to mess with the trays or rubber bands with my tongue. I am bad for chewing at my trays but have been actively trying to stop doing that. And probably my biggest complaint is the staining on my teeth with attachments. I\\'ve heard that it\\'s related to the glue and I hope that\\'s true. I don\\'t want to put any whitening in my trays because I like the color of my teeth otherwise even though they aren\\'t a neon white. But I really do hope that it\\'ll go away when they remove the attachments and I get a dental cleaning.My biggest issue is definitely the speech. Im 8 months in and still have a slight lisp and difficulty getting my words out, though its a lot better than when I had bite ramps. \\n\\nI miss wearing lipstick!! Its just not worth it if I know Im going to be taking out my retainer to eat.My usual eating style has been obliterated. I was a grazer and a snacker all day long, also I work at a restaurant and I dont get an official break (yeah illegal I know) so I can only sit down and eat a bit when I have a few minutes. Having to take the Invisalign out and put it back in so many times is frustrating. But I dont want to leave it out for two hours while I finish my mini meal 3 bites at a time. \\n\\nAlso my go to protein before was a nice big grilled chicken breast, now that is pretty uncomfortable and takes a lot of time to remove from my teeth after eating. Im leaning towards more ground turkey and deli sliced turkey these days. \\n\\nMy treatment plan is relatively short at 5.5 months and Im on my 3rd tray.I find that drinking a cup or two of hot tea after eating really helps clean my teeth before I brushThanks Š I actually love hot teaIm the type of person you snacks a lot throughout the day. I also drink coffee. Makes it impossible.Yeah Im currently eating breakfast and I try to fit 2 and a half cups of coffee in before I put my trays in ‚I\\'m certainly not a fan of feeling rushed for meals, but my least favorite thing is how the attachments make it so your teeth NEVER feel clean. The 2 or so hours a day with the trays off aren\\'t even a \"relief\" because the attachments make it feel like you have bacon bits super glued to your teethBeing pregt and having morning sickness constantly and not being able to wear the trays properly because they make me gag This was me! And then when I could smell everything, I started being able to smell my trays and just...ugh.Attachments are kind of sharp and they hurt my cheeks when I eat.The buttons that cut up your tongue to hell. My dentist said theyd only need to be in for like 8 weeks..40 weeks later still in. Supposed to be getting the buttons out on Monday and this guy better not postpone it or else Ill have to take them out myself. \\n\\nSo basically setting expectations. Also they better not come with any gd refinements. My answer to that will be NAH IM GOOD. Just give me my retainer and lets call it a day.Omg tell me about it my tongue looks like a massacre ‚The rough material that the bumps are made of were smeared onto my teeth, and its so unnatural that my tongue checks it out every time my trays are out. I thought this would stop, but its happening even now, when Im on my 9th week.Feeling like a menace here - redditors crying about a menial responsibility. Get braces if you are annoyed w Invisalign. œBut I dont want braces!!\\x9d Then stop complaining lolThat they come automatically with the elastic hooks, which I have to file down or cover in wax else they slice up my inside of my lips.\\n\\nOtherwise the problems I have are more due to my own mouth …The urge to bite down stresses my tmj i had to switch to regular braces after 3 monthsAnyone experiencing upper back and neck pain and poor posture. Since having these about 6 weeks out started slowing have neck shoulder pain.  I have weak upper back muscles (cross upper syndrome) wake up in middle night with serve headaches. I have to get up and just start moving. Same during the day I have to keep moving, if I sit or stand more than 15 mins serve pain. Neck snaps and I get random sharp pains in my head for 5-10 seconds. Started pt and dry needling. Doing a X-ray of neck and upper back this week. I clench my teeth at night since having these. I did google and there are a few articles but wanted to know from a person or persons if they experience thisBrushing teeth so much and rushing to get them back on. I brush my teeth 4 times a day, floss 3 times, and I dont put them back on if my teeth are dirty very often, unless I absolutely had to. I still got a cavity though. Im not sure if braces would of been a better option since Ive never had braces before either. Invisalign sounded like a good idea in the beginning lolEither eating on the go like others have said or the œsurprise\\x9d refinements at the end since the ortho didnt set expectations properly at the start.The rubber bands!!! And the spiky metal buttons inside and outside of my molars that the bands hook onto. They actually poke me more when trays are out. And when the bands are in (they go across my molars for the crossbite) it\\'s very springy/bouncy when I bite down.The nightmares I have almost nightly that my teeth are all jacked up and I wake up out of a sound sleep to make sure theyre not actually messed up lol. \\n\\nThat, and the lisp/sound of spit in my aligners when I say words with s or ts. Really a hassle when youre in the medical field and most of your patients are old and already have a hard time understanding you. \\n\\nKissing is another nuisance. I feel like more spit builds up in the aligners and feel like I have to constantly swallow while kissing.Knowing Ill need another round of refinements as my current program is nearing endYeah, after I got through the first week (which was absolute hell) that\\'s been my biggest issue too. No taking my time eating.Inconvenience when wanting', 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'facial appearance', 'tray time management', 'oral hygiene', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'financial concerns'], 'scores': [0.3080032169818878, 0.14903762936592102, 0.1486104130744934, 0.13833087682724, 0.10378562659025192, 0.09537158906459808, 0.056860633194446564]}, {'sequence': 'I started Invisalign three months ago, and my dentist aunt says my teeth look worse than before. Im a little scared I went to the wrong doctor, or did something wrong. Can you tell me whether things look better, worse, or no different?[deleted]Yeah, no offense to this girls aunt.but an ortho is a qualified dentist *with additional* advanced/specialized training. So I would go with the one who *actually* had training on the matter and its their job. The results mean jack shit until you get to the end.\\n\\nI would promptly ignore any further advice from the aunt from here on out.Your aunt should know better. The process in between the beginning and end mean nothing, the only thing that should count is the end result. They need to create space for movement and move things unconventionally because its not linear, only so many teeth move per tray. So once youre done, the movement has been completed over long periods of time (usually not 3 months). The end result is really the only one that should be counted.Many of us have experienced periods where our teeth looked worse before they got better. For example, I now have a gap where there wasn\\'t one before. While that was happening, however, my bite was being corrected in the back where it isn\\'t visible. The gap will be fixed with future trays.\\n\\nAll this to say, Invisalign is a process. I would assume your aunt, a dentist, understands that orthodontic work takes time and how the front teeth are currently looking doesn\\'t necessarily reflect the overall progress of the mouth.What a rude thing for your aunt to sayOur family is very abrupt generally, so not out of her character at all lol. But yeah, she did make me panicIts not a rude thing to say at all. She is correct fundamentally. The curvature of the lower arch has changedI don\\'t know why you\\'re down voted. You\\'re correct, the arches look off compared to at the beginningLol I know. Im being downvoted by people who have no understanding of the fundamentals of occlusion. Imagine thatIsn\\'t it possible to be rude and correct at the same time?\\n\\nNot sure what the fundementals of occlusion have to do with having a bit of tactIf your correct its not rude when OP was asking for advice.If you arent finished with treatment, then theyll look worse before they look better. Your teeth have to move to get to that œperfect\\x9d position and that in between stage is never pretty. My top 2 teeth were crowded and now the gap is so big that my lip gets stuck in it. Its all part of the progress. Im sure others will agree.Four months in, I have buck teeth and gaps all over the place that were not there before. I am a hot mess. But I saw the clincheck and understand this is a means to an end. It really does got worse before it gets better. \\n\\nThink about when you rearrange furniture in a room. You only have so much space in the room to move everything around. You start with the furniture in some sense of order but as you work toward the finished positioning every piece ends up a bit out of place until eventually it all comes into place.That makes sense. I did hear the it gets worse before it gets better before, just got a little caught off guard hearing how bad my teeth look from a professional (who is also my aunt) lolHaven\\'t you seen your clincheck? Did you like the end results and are you tracking well? That\\'s what matters with invisalign.Yeah, Im right on track, and never have any aches with Invisalign so its been a breeze. I guess I started to believe my teeth were already looking better and it took my dentist aunt to say it looks bad for me to see itAs others said they would look worse. But it should be part of the plan and you should know the plan and like the end result of the clincheck.  Just because your aunt is a dentist doesn\\'t mean she understands orthodontics jobs and how it works and how teeth and jaw moves. I currently have gaps in my teeth that weren\\'t there when I started but my whole plan is about creating these gaps to allow my teeth to move back cuz they are a bit too forwardLike everyone said itll look worse before it gets better!Thank you, I agree which is why I didnt have any problems with some teeth improving and some looking a bit awkward. Feels kind of panicky when a dentist relative says sth like thatTotally understand the panic, I have braces and literally the days after I got them on I was freaking out cause my teeth looked horrible when they werent that bad before. Itll get better for sure!They don\\'t look worse! Your arches look wider and straighter and your teeth are no longer tipping in toward your tongue. I think how straight they are makes the lower position of your front two teeth more noticeable, but hopefully that will be fixed in future trays. Hang in there!Thank you, this explanation made me feel better about why my front tooth seems to be lower (but it is perfectly aligned with the tray, so seems like its on track)Definitely looks better. The upper arch appears wider which makes your smile more appealing.  Also, the incisor is less \"snaggle\" so your eye doesn\\'t get drawn to it.\\n\\nedit due to spellingGet a new aunt smhYour dentist aunt isnt an orthodontist?No, she doesnt do braces herself either. But her surprise reaction really got to me, like I messed up my teeth or sthI wouldnt worry about her opinion. Id only be worried if your provider is concernedIf she doesnt even do braces, let alone Invisalign, then I wouldnt take her comment as being helpful. So many who are going through or done with the process are saying its normal - let alone the professionals that say the same.Normal, they push them outwards and create gaps then move them back in straight and closing the gaps.  You are on track.I\\'d day they look significantly better. We have the tilt needed now. Your teeth were tilted in and now they\\'re more outwards which will be good. They\\'re not done though. Ask tonsee your clincheck again and don\\'t worry about your aunt dentist. Show us the clincheck if you want outside opinion.I dont think they look worse. You can tell that your arch is getting wider. Even if they did, its not over til its over. Sometimes they do look worse before your done. Ignore her. Shes not treating you. Shes also not an ortho.I havent started yet, but just from browsing this sub, the glue dots definitely make judging progress harder. I have to look very closely when viewing before and in progress posts. I can notice an improvement in your teeth. But thats just me!Thank you! Yeah, I was thinking one front tooth that was going forward was looking better as well as the bottom, but there is definitely some awkwardness for my front teeth at the moment :/Oh the improvements in your smile arc are 10/10 worth itThe first five months of mine I had two gaps on the top and bottom right side. One side of my smile was full and it looked like the other was missing, it was awful lol its been a few months and I\\'m loving the results! Definitely check with your orthodontist.Im scheduled to see my ortho next week so Ill definitely bring this up. But its really great to hear that the teeth looking worse is potentially normal/part of the process :)As an align technician, sometimes you have to make some spaces with \"roundtripping\" to correct rotations/bucco-lingual movements more efficientlyThank you for the comment, great to also hear from another professional :) I definitely know more space is being created between my teeth right now. The last time I went to my ortho, they were able to add a couple additional buttons they could not put in the first time because there wasnt enough space at firstMine got worse before they got better. I had a major roatation on one tooth (it was almost sitting sideways it was so rotated inward). My teeth were protruding out of my mouth for a quite a few trays as it was making my arch wider to make room for all my teeth. \\n\\nBut now Im almost done with my treatment and they look beautiful!Thats great to hear! Congrats on your progress. Hopefully mine will get better tooEveryone is saying its normal to look worse before it looks better but the 2nd one literally looks better? The teeth are straighterYour teeth can actually look worse before they look better. The way your teeth have to shift in order to be straight eventually could be in a direction that makes them look worse at first. Then after a while they will shift in a different direction and will look better. Not everyone has the same experience, but my bottom teeth looked terrible until about 6 months in. Dont worry Im sure your orthodontist knows what hes doing! Dont listen to what other uneducated people say either „they dont know what they are talking about and clearly have no regard for your feelings.\\n\\nEdit: also they could appear worse just bc of those buttons on your teeth. It seemed like they made my teeth look hella wonky.Based in the comments here, I do think that perhaps my aunt isnt too familiar with the process of how Invisalign treatment should work (create gaps, push teeth forward etc which can make it look bad), so she did give me a huge scare lol. But the responses here really helped :)Your aunt is a dentist, but is she an orthodontist? ‰She is a dentist, so she does very basic stuff (does not do Invisalign and/or braces)Then her opinion is completely and utterly irrelevant œHow many trays are you supposed to have? If you still have a ways to go then dont worry too much. Some people have a bad look before the end result looks gooodI have a total of 32, and Im at tray 10 right now. So, still a lot to go through. I guess I just thought things were improving (wishful thinking perhaps), but some teeth are probably looking a little awkward at this stageI think it looks like your arch is wider now (as planned), and not by any means ÂworseÂ»? Weird comment from auntie there …Im on my 17th tray. Had a lower front tooth removed to eliminate crowded, crooked teeth. So I started with a fairly large gap but still within the parameters of correction. Im in the scary phase now. Teeth have moved and one is wobbly. Its normal, but it feels so weird. Im actually more comfortable with the tray in than when its out. Its hard to bite into certain foods too. And when I take my tray out, Im worried I can pull out that wobbly tooth. I see my ortho regularly and am reassured this is working. \\n\\nSo what Im saying is that this middle stage is scary as hell.She is correct, your mandibular curve of spee appears much better in your first picture. It will be interesting to see how it progresses. \\n\\nAlso, this is not the form to ask for dental advice to the extent that you are asking. A vast majority of people here dont have an ounce of dental training.

Good luck to all those still on your own!Gorgeous! Congrats!Beautiful smile!!!!Beautiful!Looks amazing! I'm also on the way through 34 initial trays, currently on tray 5. Looks like you also had some posterior crossbite? How much did you wear the elastics?Thanks! I cant remember how the bite issues were described but what you said sounds familiar so maybe I did have that. I wore elastics 22 hrs per day or basically every time I had the trays in. For the last maybe 3 or 4 weeks of treatment I graduated to wearing them just at night which was nice. Really happy to be done with those things altogether now!Got it, thanks for replying! I've been wearing them about half the day so far, but your results are inspiring me to wear them as much as I can.Yeah definitely do as much as you can. I figured it would suck to go through all this effort and cost and then for it to either take a lot longer or not end up with a good result so I did what I was told for the most part and wore the hell out of my trays. That said I wasnt obsessive about it - I was doing weekly switches and by the time I was at tray 10 or so I relaxed a bit and wore them more like 20 hours per day on average or basically just got a bit lazier on brushing and putting them back in immediately after eating and would instead get to it maybe 30 minutes or up to an hour after eating. I made sure each one was fitting/tracking really well and kept getting good feedback from my ortho. So you could probably wear them longer but still have a sense of flexibility if you wanted.How do you count the refinements?  At the end of the treatment you just tell them what you want fixed?In this case (and same for others Im sure) they do a scan near the end of the initial round of trays and then they basically tell me how many more trays as part of the refinements I would need, in my case 19. I think this was the recommendation to correct the bite issues and essentially fix the issue there and this will be different for everyone. Near the end of my set of refinement trays he let me know that the bite and the tooth placement was good and then I had the opportunity to let him know about any specific teeth I had an issue with. I basically said œgood enough!\\x9d but I think if I wanted certain things adjusted thats where we would have done additional rounds of refinements for that specific purposeWow looks AMAZINGIf you get your retainers now, and then get bonding. Do you just got back to your ortho after  and they'll give you a new retainer ?The exact same question I hadall the more so because for some dumb reason the Invisalign brand retainers (vivera I think they are called) cost extra after its all said and done. So yes I asked about that and they said the eventual bonding wont affect the retainer fit. Dunno if thats generally true or if they made a little note on my scan for the Invisalign people or what. But either way when the time comes it better fit or I will be expecting a freebie ‰Looks awesome —‘\\x8d‘\\x8fBeautiful! Congratulations!Now that youre done with initial trays and refinementshow long did your orthro tell you you need to keep wearing trays for 22 hours a day before you can shift to night only? Ive seen some people say 6-12 months and it makes me sad to contemplate -_-. I will be happy to be elastic free eventually though.I think he said all day for 4 to 6 months before switching to nights but Ill have to double check that when I go pick up the new retainers next week. I agree, huge bummer to be done but then not really done at all. It will be all the more annoying because Ill have had two weeks with no trays (just permanent retainer) and it has been heaven to be able to eat and drink whatever and brush my teeth a normal amount of times per day - Im just trying to enjoy it and l know it will soon come to an end ¹I know its an odd question, but did you lose any weight during this treatment?No, fair question I hear that a lot! I didnt, however. I guess I managed to cram just as many calories as usual into a smaller window of time ·\\x8d‚ï¸\\x8fIve lost about 30 poundsThat looks amazing! I bet youre so pleased. Im due to have my attachments put on in June. Id love a result like yours.Thank you so much! Im super happy with the result and so glad I did it. Im sure it will turn out well for you too! In the end the attachments were just an annoyance it was the elastics I grew to hate ‚. The first couple days you will wonder if you will ever get used to the attachment bits jutting out but amazingly you willThanks. Im super nervous about getting them, as Ill have them on most of my teeth, including the front ones. Just keeping in mind the end game. \\x81Yes thats right, keep the end in mind! I got many comments that the attachments were not really that noticeable. Of course they will be to you because they stand out as different and you can feel them. You will likely forget they are there. Weirdly my teeth felt too smooth after they were removed, amazing what we can get used to ºï¸\\x8fim sure you didnt mean 19 refinements/scans but 19 trays of refinements?Lol you are correct - 19 trays of refinements and the 1 roundwas it 19 after 34 trays? i thought refinements are usually brush ups hence is not so extensive. if it was another 19 trays after the initial 34 trays, was it for something that the doctor did not address in the initial treatment plan?Yes it was 19 more trays after the initial set of 34. It was not for anything that wasnt discussed initially, I was told up front that the number of refinement trays could be as many as the initial round or even more. I think it had to do with a certain amount of uncertainty in terms of how long it would take or what would happen as they corrected my bite, though Im not really too sure. I thought it was weird too but then just tried to mentally remember that it wasnt really the end of treatment at all as I got closer to 34 - since of course i didnt know it was going to be 19 extra trays until after I was scanned on tray 34. That helped me manage my expectations a bit. I mean I was going to do however many he or the scanning suggested I do so if he said there was going to be a lot or a few it didnt really matter or rather there wasnt much to do about it!\", 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'oral hygiene', 'tray time management', 'facial appearance', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'financial concerns'], 'scores': [0.26887309551239014, 0.17093776166439056, 0.1614072471857071, 0.12636978924274445, 0.11640655249357224, 0.08149820566177368, 0.07450737059116364]}, {'sequence': \"Invisalign results!

Thanks again!Thanks so much for your reply - even today my teeth are less sore and eating is more comfortableHas anyone had braces on one set of teeth and Invisalign on the other set? This is what was prescribed for me. Wondering if anyone has any experience.For those of you who had bonding, IPR, and/or whitening done as part of your treatment, was it explicitly stated in your contract that they would be done? Did your provider suggest them? Did you have to ask? \\n\\nI\\'m approaching the end of my treatment and there\\'s been no mention of bonding/IPR/whitening yet.. I\\'m wondering if I should bring them up.Think it depends on where you live and what kind of provider you selected. Cosmetic dentists typically quote or suggest these things up front as part of the perfect smile or smile transformation consultations while regular dentists and orthodontist in certain countries may be limited in what they can perform so typically dont or cant include them. \\n\\nI would ask - but you may either be charged extra or be referred elsewhere. Unfortunately if not in your contract/quote you agreed to they may not be included.I appreciate the response, thank you!\\n\\nFor reference, I went through a local orthodontist. I went through the Treatment Contract last night and it says the Treatment Type is \"Adult Comprehensive.\" And then in the \"Non-Ideal Results\" section it says, \"Restorative dental treatment, such as esthetic bonding, crowns or bridges or periodontal therapy, may be indicated. You are encouraged to ask your orthodontist and family dentist about adjunctive care.\" \\n\\nThere\\'s no further details surrounding either of these, so it\\'s not *super* helpful. I\\'ll have the ask when I go in for a checkup with the Orthodontist Owner in a few weeks.Yes, it seems hit or miss as Invisalign trays can obviously only move the teeth - everything else would be dependent on the providers skills and what they are allowed to do per each jurisdictions standards.\\n\\nFor example where I am outside of the US, orthodontists refer you other practices for bonding so most treatment plans here dont include it. I am sure this leaves a lot of folks disappointed because their smile cant be corrected with just braces and are left with minor imperfections unlike all of Invisaligns marketing images ·\\x8d‚ï¸\\x8fThat makes complete sense, thank you. I\\'m not sure what my orthodontist is allowed to do, but I do know they\\'re the premier local provider of Invisalign... So hopefully they can do bonding! I\\'ve made it this far (55 weeks in).

And now that I popped my second tray in tonight, I really feel like I can do this. You got this ’›Thanks so much, I\\'m glad to hear that it did subside for you. Has eating been inconvenient?Yes and I called them crying the second day saying I couldnt eat and clean and all that while still keeping them in for 22 hours lol Im a slow eater so its been tricky but now Im in a good place. The first few days was rough cause my attachments shifted my bite so I just had easy food like corn dogs and mashed potatoes. Also do add - I took Tylenol the first few days cause the aligners were hard to take out. My advice would be to take them out quicker rather than slowly and when snapping them in, push in the side thats most painful first.Thanks! What was the result of the bite shifting, why did that make it harder?\\n\\nThanks for the tips! I\\'ve also found quicker to be less painful, I think (of course it could be correlation rather than causation, where as time has gone on it hurts less *and* I can do it more quickly, but it\\'d make sense either way.) Snapping them in starting with the most painful side is an interesting tip I will try!\\n\\nI haven\\'t been taking Tylenol yet just since I want to observe and acclimate to however painful it starts off; then, if I take it down the line on future trays, I\\'ll know how much good it\\'s doing me.\\x9dï¸\\x8f\\x9dï¸\\x8f\\x9dï¸\\x8f\\x9dï¸\\x8f Never feel shy about sending me a DM!Yes it gets better, your mouth,tongue will adjust so just keep talking to yourself at home or when you cooking out loud and the words will come out easier.\\n\\nEvery new tray you might have a lisp but it should get less and lessIm on my second to last tray and honestly sometimes I still have a lisp! Most of the time it isnt noticeable at ALL but I find my mouth gets dryer with Invisalign which causes the lisp. Loud bars and yelling = lisp.. work calls, cant tell at all.

Kind of tedious to keep calling whenever there\\'s a mishapI\\'ve heard of many people have attachments fall off - I got mine on today and lost one immediately during eating. Luckily they were able to get me back in and apply a new one on the same day. I think there\\'s a number of factors at play - including how the attachment was applied - so it\\'s not entirely on the patient.\\n\\nI\\'m being super-cautious now that I\\'m eating dinner - super soft foods, careful chewing (hard not to with the sharp edges on these things) and constantly checking if the attachments are still there.\\n\\nI imagine after a while I\\'ll feel more confident in their adhesion, and people say that the sharp edges tend to wear down over time, but it\\'s definitely an adjustment for now.Definitely. Eating is such a pain and feels so weird right now. Good luck tomorrow morning though. The first day felt like nothing but my teeth hurt like hell the 2nd day.I thought you\\'re not supposed to eat with them in!?The aligned trays, yes, they need to come out while eating, but the attachments are glued onto the teeth, so no eating with attachments would be rather difficult.Mine fall off all the timeDo the attachment bumps cut up the inside of your mouth when you eat? The trays themselves are fine but when I take them out the bumps (dental cement or whatever) cut up my mouth when I eat. Help?Same here. I keep biting  the inside of my mouth.Yes, when I eat it happens. I\\'m on day 5 of my journey so I guess skin will get used to it.You get used to it, it doesnt happen the whole time.

Or just depending on what you\\'re eating or drinking?I do the entire thing, plus rubber bands. 55 weeks in with hopefully not many more to go.

My eating habits have drastically changed, as well as my gym routine... But it\\'s only temporary. Hang in there.Just curious, how exactly does it change gym routine for someone?What all has changed about your eating habits, and what do you do with rubber bands?Rubber bands are used to fix my slight under bite (pull the top teeth forward and lower teeth back). \\n\\nBecause it\\'s a hassle to take rubber bands/trays out, eat, brush my teeth, put the trays/rubber bands in, then bite on my little chewy thing, I\\'ve transitioned to eating fewer, significantly larger meals per day (I used to eat smaller meals nearly nonstop).Got it, thanks! Should I assume rubber bands aren\\'t necessary in my specific case if my dentist said nothing about them?Depends what I\\'m eating and when. I brush after each meal so if I need to have a snack an hour or two before that, I just take the trays out, swish with water and put them back in. Might not be the ideal practice but it keeps me from starving and my wear time is high.If you are cavity prone Id recommend doing it all. But there was so many days where Id just rinse my mouth and put them back. Also if I was ever out of the house I would chew gum and put them back in. just make sure you brush and floss at the end of the night.

Cheap?) reasonable in terms of price? Ive never had braces but my mom always wishes she got me braces growing up for a crooked tooth and Im considering it if its reasonable.Total treatment is 5,770. Got a $500 discount, so 5,270. Put 1,670 down and make $150 monthly payments for 24 months, interest free! My best advise is shop around and do consultations! A lot of places have flexible payment plans :)I went with an orthodontist, who has his own tray making system, and he\\'s only doing 4 months and slight adjustments to 2 overlapping teeth. $2100 US. I was quoted $4500 by a dentist for Invisalign, but went to the Ortho based on recommendations in this sub.I just got quoted 6800 USD for 24 months.Cost me about $5k. I got a discount for paying in full.i just started today, paid 6500 canadian over 20 months, 1000 down paymentMine is 5000 USD. All paid at once, my insurance doesn\\'t cover braces of any kind for adults. I\\'d say it\\'s expensive.\\n\\nI had braces as a kid too but didn\\'t wear my retainers... but had a bunch of work in my mouth going on that *mostly* stuck, so now I only have to wear these for 36 trays, changed weekly.I paid $500 down and $230 per month over the next year. But I could have done $150 but it would have interest.I have the comprehensive treatment for $5,475 (USD). Paid $1,700 down and have a fairly aggressive payment schedule at \\\\~$300/month for a year. My treatment time is short however.If you don\\'t pay for it now, you might end up with more expensive dental problems later on when you get older and your jaw naturally narrows. I woke up one day with a noticeable chip out of my tooth just from my teeth shifting naturally (I\\'ve never had braces).

I just got mine on a few hours ago and haven\\'t heard about cold waterEveryone including my ortho said cold water is fine but I found that as soon as I drank them within a few hours of my first tray, I was in so much pain. It could honestly just be a coincidence but it didnt hurt like that until after I had the ice water.Interesting, thanks! I haven\\'t had any issues with it yet but also haven\\'t drank anything ice cold.

My dentist said its not ideal to drink coffee with them in but its not the worst.\\nSecond day I drank 2 lattes and swished with water (I was in a meeting).\\nToday I was home so used mouthwash.\\nToo early for me to tell if this is reasonable but hopefully some of the veterans will chime inMine got a little yellowed from drinking a bunch of coffee daily with two week changes. Not enough to bother me (tea did though - I don\\'t recommend drinking black tea with trays in). I wash with toothpaste or dish soap and sometimes soak them in hydrogen peroxide.Best mobile toothbrush/cleaning set ups? Anyone try the Colgate wisps?Does drinking stuff that isn\\'t water simply stain the trays, or can it affect the function of the plastic? I don\\'t think I\\'ll try this because I usually just drink water anyways, but I\\'m curious.Its really the staining and bacteria/sugar stuff that can cause gum,teeth issues sitting on the tooth.\\n\\nObviously drinking hot drinks through it can warp them on top of staining but apart from that those are the main reasons.That makes sense... Thanks!Obviously it depends what drink you\\'re speaking of, but I think the biggest risk is enamel loss due to anything carbonated or acidic being held against your teethI just got my first tray fitted today, tray 1 of 15. Is it normal that Im not feeling sore? I did have a bit of looseness in my lower teeth because Im 9 months postpartum (another joy of pregcy is loosened ligaments and even teeth sometimes).My dentist told me that in her experience, pregcy and loosened ligaments can result in the teeth moving more quickly and with less discomfort. I did specifically ask her about it because I\\'m trying to conceive and I was worried that becoming pregt in the middle of my Invisalign treatment might cause issues because of the looser teeth thing. I didn\\'t realize that that could continue postpartum. That\\'s interesting!Yes my teeth have continued to feel wobbly and loose; it was even giving me nightmares of losing my teeth or all of my teeth sliding around and probably causing me to test out the wiggly-ness of them even more. \\n\\nWith each child I had (my third and last baby is 8 months old now), my teeth that were once straight after a year of braces when I was 12, got more and more crowded with a slight zigzag look. They still look straight unless you look closely or if I open my mouth, but what prompted me to go to the ortho was knowing that with the looseness theyll probably get worse or even fall out if theyre not stabilized.\\n\\nIm on day 4, and its definitely been an easy adjustment so far. I think the looseness helps, but Im just hoping that theyll firm up well afterwards. The ortho said Ill need a permanent retainer bar behind the lower teeth.ill be honest im a bit scared - \\n\\ncurrently on 3/33, got the rubber bands and the attachments. ortho is a great guy, long respected ortho with a strong history. \\n\\nafter the attachments and the bands, i went to my barber and we were discussing it, he mentioned that the process messed up his jaw/bite permanently, aka what im trying to fix with my bite.\\n\\nim just extremely worried that there is the possibility that this could happen. has anyone here experienced that?Trust your Orthodontist over your barber.Truth Ive been wearing the bands and its not so bad anymoreHow common are the rubber bands with invisalign? Do people take them off for pictures and such (thus creating the appearance that they are less common than they are)?Depends if you have bite issues. I don\\'t, so I don\\'t have the rubber bands.Is it possible for bad tracking to fix itself if I increase my wear time and start using chewies more often? Went to the dentist recently and was told a couple teeth weren\\'t tracking as well as they should, but for us to wait and see. I\\'d rather not extend my treatment if possible, so I\\'ve been chomping on my chewie like a dog ever since.Stubborn teeth are common and refinements are usually necessary to \\'focus\\' on the tooth needing to be moved more.\\n\\nJust stick the course and be compliant. dont over do the chewie as it can damage the tray and wear it out/crack. Just do it normally and see how the journey goes. most refinements are 1 week trays so it usually flys by and you barely notice the extra wear time because you been doing it for ages, \\n\\nPlus you wear a retainer for the rest of your life to keep them in place at night so just have to get use to wearing them.Ok, I was worried maybe I\\'m not doing enough and that\\'s why I had some stubborn teeth, but I\\'ll just keep complying and won\\'t overdo the chewie. Thank you :)How do I floss if I have permet retainers on?! I just got them on and I can no longer use my flossers :(Buy the little plastic sticks with rubber brushes at the end, rather than trying to use floss string.Are those reusable? I thought of buying them but they are expensive.They\\'re not supposed to be. And yeah they are expensive depending on where you get them from, I found them at the dollar store for much cheaper. idk what country you\\'re in.. check Amazon and buy in bulkI have an appointment to get my attachments and aligners on June 1st. My honeymoon in June 17th. Should I postpone for when I return?Maybe? It\\'s not the most stressful thing in the world removing your retainers, timing your meal, cleaning your retainers and then cleaning your teeth before putting them back in...\\\\*but\\\\* I think your honeymoon would be a lot more relaxing without the hassle. Will you be out and about a lot? I\\'ve had my Invisalign since December and have been mostly fine...I stick to restaurants that I know have nice clean, private bathrooms so I can clean in peace. however, I just got back from my first vacation abroad since having them in and I have to say it was ANNOYING. I was meeting with friends around town a lot, and in new places where I would go to the bathroom to remove my retainers before eating and just think \"nope no way am I using this bathroom to clean my teeth!\" Because you will most likely be out of town, you won\\'t have as much control over access to somewhere clean to clean your teeth and retainers after meals, so it could be a nuisance. Having said that, if you\\'re going to a remote cottage or something and plan on staying in/close to the house/apartment all the time, or going to a resort where you can just run up to your room whenever you want to brush your teeth, it probably won\\'t bother you as much.Thank you. This was helpful. Yes, I\\'ll be out and about a lot so I\\'m trying to reschedule it.How much does an initial consultation for Invisalign cost where they take a look, show what the  end result could be, and determine what all could be involved? Would your normal dentist do this or would you have to go to some specialist? Can Invisalign handle if a tooth needs to be rotated a little?Impossible to say how much it costs without knowing your location.\\n\\nThey\\'ll take a look at your teeth and if you\\'re a good candidate and you want to sign up for it, you make an appointment to get your teeth scanned so they can create the 3D model etc.\\n\\nInvisalign can do rotations, depends on your situation.\\n\\nGo to an ortho that specialises in Invisalign. There\\'s a list on the website.ThanksHas anyone noticed their teeth changing height/shape? I did Invisalign on dentist recommendation because my top row was crooked and hurt. Im now on my second to last tray and noticed 2/4 of my bottom front-most teeth are sticking up higher than the two next to them, like a gopher. And the top of those teeth are wavy, but werent like that before. Starting to worry that Ive created a problem while solving another ¶Anyone with invisalign retainers,, what tablets do you use to clean them ?Im a fan of retainer brite, you can find it on Amazon.Im on tray 17/20 and Im not happy with the progress so far :(My dentist quoted me$4800, Id need to wear for 12 months. \\n\\nMy teeth are pretty straight already, just some slight crowding in bottom middle teeth, nothing major. \\n\\nIs this high or normal?Just because they look good from the front, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not complex. My top front teeth looked good, and the bottom-front teeth don\\'t take long to straighten. The reason I\\'m on Invisalign for so long is because the molars and canines take forever to move.I\\'m supposed to need invisaligners (or braces in general), and I have several questions:\\n\\n1. I believe they told me I only need like 3 months or something like that (it may have been 6, but I know it was a lot less time than I\\'ve heard braces take). Is this normal? I don\\'t have horrible teeth, but the front of my teeth don\\'t touch the bottom, and I have a gap and one bad tooth. \\n2. My regular dr prescribed Prednisone this month, and it\\'s not a question of whether or not I should take it, but that I HAVE to (I really was trying to avoid it :/). Can I still get invisaligners? I hear they need inflammation to work, and the whole reason I\\'m taking Prednisone is to get rid of it in my neck >\\\\_<;.\\n3. Is there absolutely any way to get the cost reduced? I actually need them medically (My dr said this is possibly and likely TMJ, and the last time I went to the dentist, he said my bite is causing this, so it definitely seems medical. I\\'ve had unexplained neck pain since October of last year, and my jaw has been getting increasingly worse). But literally everything I\\'ve read says I can\\'t get help at all due to the fact I\\'m over 21. :/. My dentist\\'s price is fine (he\\'s about average for this), but I can\\'t really afford the payments. They\\'d want me at the dentist to pay half up front and then pay them $150 a month, which I can\\'t do (they originally told me it\\'d just be $150 a month for 8 months, THEN told me I have to pay half upfront.. One I could do temporarily, but the other I can\\'t. A $5500 card bill equates to like $200 a month, which I don\\'t have). I\\'d have no money except for bills. This all seems grossly unfair when this is medical, not cosmetic (I don\\'t care about the gap TBH) My doctor is even surprised they won\\'t do anything, as it is medical.I have zero idea why the dentist can\\'t just do payments there, so I don\\'t have to have such a high freaking bill due to the interest.\\n4. Would this actually get rid of TMJ? It\\'s the only reason I\\'m even considering braces. I really don\\'t care about this issue cosmetically, as I\\'ve just come to accept I have a gap.Is it normal for an orthodontist not to do the itero scan at your consultation? I was thinking I would see the Clincheck during my consultation, so I could see a possible outcome of treatment. Maybe I completely misunderstood what is done at a consultation. I did have xrays that were evaluated.Not necessarily.

Truly, it's very manageable!!!\\n\\nPain wise, I was expecting to cry myself to sleep and to finish a bottle of Tylenol immediately after putting on my set of aligners. In reality, I had a very MILD discomfort over the aligners. The discomfort left after a day or two and I never had issues with eating. I have multiple attachments and they never cut into my mouth or anything like that (never used any dental wax either). I do not have elastics so I can't really advise that matter.\\n\\nMy most painful aligner was probably midway through my treatment and when I say painful, this is still mild like I can still eat and perform normal activities without thinking of the pain. \\n\\nWear time; I always get 20h in but if I go out like a party and whatnot, I'll take them out and that's it. \\n\\nI understand that people want to complain and get comforted, it's totally normal and human. It's also important to remember that when you read posts, we all have different experiences and it's easier to find complaints than happy and satisfied people. Take what you see with a grain of salt and go get that Invisalign!!The worst thing about it is the maintece. At worst its a bit inconvenient/just one more thing to deal with. Never found Invisalign to be that painful at all. Have elastics and they feel like nothing for me.Yeah it's incredibly hard if you're used to snacking and drinking stuff on and off all day. Not the end of the world thoughTotally! My treatment is not that long (a bit less than a year) so I haven't reached a point of high annoyance. The amount of brushing and flossing was the thing that truly annoyed me but overtime, it started to feel quite natural ? Idk I think I also may be very goal oriented and when I'm annoyed I just think and focus on the results I wanna achieve.Im just reaching month 25 …Agreed. The worst part is having to floss, rinse and brush after meal but then again my tooth have probably never been cleaner and my breath is always minty fresh.I think it just becomes a part of life after a month or so, you learn the best ways to manage it and then the maintece is second nature. I never was and probably never will be a snacker so I guess that made it easier!I'm at about 6 months. The first week or two were my tough spots.  Getting used to taking them in and out.  Not snacking as much. Little ache with new aligners. Now it's no big deal.  If I want to snack I take them out, eat. Rinse and pop them back in.  I only brush about 3 times a day.  I keep those mini flossers with me all the time.  It's easy to quickly floss with those.  If I'm out I generally just swish with water and brush when I get the chance.  I manage to get about 22 hours daily. Some days a little less. I don't overthink it.  If I'm going to a party or dinner I sometime don't wear them out.  I will wear them an extra day if I have slacked on wear time.  \\n\\nMy bite has Def changed and I eat slower and try to eat healthier. I've lost a few pounds over the past 6 months, that's a plus.  \\n\\nOne thing that I think makes it easy for me is that I'm older, 61. I had to pay the entire price, insurance won't cover when you get my age.  I'm happy that I will finally get the nice smile I've always wanted.  All in all these are so much easier than metal braces. More comfy,  not as noticeable. So glad I decided to get them!Wow! Such a truthful comment. I had wanted Invisalign for 10 years roughly so I think it may also play into the positive outlook I have even when I felt like I struggledThis is awesome! Happy for you for going after the smile you've always wanted. And 6 months in! How much longer do you have to go?At least another 6. But my son is getting married in 6 months and I won't be wearing the aligners that day and I will be huge smiling for all the pictures! That was the push I needed to go for braces! \\n\\nThank you!How much did you have you pay if you dont mind sharing? My insurance wont cover mine either since Im older so Ill have to pay all out of pocket.I paid just under $5000. I set it up on a payment plan for 2 years. I pay something like $230/month.  I am in the southern USA.  Medium size city. I did stress about this cost since I am 'retired,' but now that I'm seeing the changes in my teeth it's worth every penny.Thanks for sharing. I dont blame you for stressing out about the cost but Im glad that youre feeling that its worth it. \\n\\nIve been going back and forth about really looking into it and have seen much higher pricing than the $5000, so that seems a bit more reasonable.Only the first tray really hurt. After that, it's just been pressure for the first few hours after changing.My experience is very similar. This sub scared the crap out of me to the point I wouldnt answer my orthodontists calls to come pick up my trays for over a month. \\n\\nTurns out, only about 5% of it was the actual case. Invisalign is not nothing, but its super manageable and, in my experience, completely pain free. No need for all of this excessive wear time, tooth brushing, gear buying business at all. Take your trays out to eat and put them back in after. Otherwise, proceed with normal life. The only challenge was getting used to having them in my mouth, really.Yeah, the trouble with stuff like this is the people in pain are the most vocal.  I'm on tray 42 of 49 and zero pain.  Honestly I forget they're there must of the time until I want to eat or drink something, then you have to do the ritual.Gear buying  I bought the orthokey because I don't like putting my fingers in my mouth and that's about it lol my main challenge was the lisp I had for to weeks and as you said, just getting used to them and not eating randomlyThe lisp took a little while to go „I found mine to be quite painful initially but I had a jacked up root canal prior so it was expected. That said after a few weeks it was fine. I found I came to like the ache I had whenever I switched trays. Meant it was working. The maintece of it isnt even that bad. You get used to taking them out to eat and cleaning when you can. I know some people are really anal about brushing right after but if Im out and dont have anything on me Ill just rinse my mouth or they stay out till I get home.  Ive never had traditional braces but I suspect Invisalign is a nicer experience overall.Same for the ache hahaha I felt satisfied to know my teeth were moving. More than an ache, it just felt tight. Honestly I was so happy I could still drink my coffee even if it was with a straw and with gulps of water in between I wanted to ask you about coffee but saw there'd been so many comments already ‚ didn't want to add more questions! Do you really drink coffee through a straw? I'm a coffee fiend so might have to do the same when I get mine I only drink my coffee through a straw if it's iced tbh. I normally only drink one coffee a day so I'll have it with my meal and my aligners aren't in. But I'm also a uni student and sometimes I need coffee when my aligners need to be in. I'll drink it with a little bit of cream to try not to stain the aligners and I'll let it cool so my aligner isn't damaged either. I'll swish with water every few gulp and one big swish at the end. So far so good and no cavities! \\n\\nI do hear some ppl actually drink coffee hot/cold through the straw. I think it's more useful if you're someone that likes to sip it through the day which isn't really my case.Omg thank you for reminding me not to drink hot drinks with my aligners in ¦\\x8f¼\\x8dï¸\\x8f‚ thanks for such a detailed reply this is really helpful!Just got my first tray on Tuesday and so far its been pretty painful for the first three days. Its the worst when I take them off to eat. Im hoping for the light at the end of the tunneli experienced the EXACT SAME thing. whenever i would take them out to eat for the first week or two, my bottom teeth would hurt like hell and id stand there clutching my mouth. but after those first few weeks, you get used to it and its definitely not as bad. honestly, ive gotten to like the ache that it gives my teeth at beginning of a new set. there is light at the end, trust me.Hang in there! I think that we also get used to the pain at least a little bit, to the pain. I remember when I started and the ache was very present but as the aligners went on, it started to be in the background of my brain since I was used to having them inWee! Thats what im hoping for. I know the pain definitely is part of the process and is super manageable. Im so excited for the results. Good luck with yours!It gets better! I was having massive regrets the first few days but everything will settle in quite soon.Im 5 weeks in. First week was easily the most painful. Im switching trays weekly, so my mouth does stay moderately sore, which takes some of the joy out of eating. But the super uncomfortable part is gone after week 1.I got my first tray on Tuesday, too! I find the most pain is taking them off. There's a bottom tooth that is super sensitive and I feel like the tray removal just really intensifies it. And then I have to give my mouth a few minutes to settle before I try and bite, my bite even after only 4 days, feels off, which surprised me. I thought it would take longer for that. My main gripe is that I can't close my mouth naturally at rest with them in and I hate how it ooks. I hope it improves. Otherwise wearing them feels great and I actually think it looks strangely cute when I'm talking and smiling.as someone with sensory issues and an *absolute baby* when it comes to pain who already deals with chronic sharp pain with chronic illness, im very grateful for this sub. Im much more prepared than I would have been otherwise.\\n\\nwith aquaphor, midol (it helps with pain inear my head better than anything else for some reason), along with prepared soft foods (boiled eggs, bread soaked in soup, thinly sliced deli meat, grated cheese, smoothies, and pouches of yogurt, of applesauce, of chia seeds, and of mashed veggies/fruit), ive been able to handle it. the first tray sucked - i didnt realize how much of my mood was affected by pain - but after adjusting to the dullness of the pain (and the fact that dull pain doesnt SPIKE like sharp pain does!!!) im doing pretty good at the end of my first day of tray 2.\\n\\nits like a corset for my teeth, almost. a tight, shaping, mouth-bone hug ‚\\n\\nif anyones reading the comments, if you dont have sensory issues or issues with pain - youll be fine!\\n\\nand if you DO have some of the issues I doIve found it manageable ’œMy first tray hurt like hell for about a 24 hours, I had Tylenol but couldnt sleep the first night and took a sick day. \\n\\nPast that, changing trays hurts a bit so I put them on at night. A little sore taking them out for breakfast but a single Tylenol takes care of it. \\n\\nThe maintece is a little aggravating but Im not so strict, I probably wear them 18 hours a day. Weekly changes.\\n\\nEveryones experience is probably different but thats mine.Agreed, when I was reading this subreddit I thought the pain would be a lot worse.  Maybe I'll run into it on a future tray, but I just started tray four and I haven't really had any pain.\\n\\nMild discomfort while taking the trays out, and on my first tray it was uncomfortable to bite down too hard with my front 2 upper teeth, but outside of that, nothing.  When I put in a new tray I can certainly feel that they are tighter and are pushing on my teeth, but I certainly wouldn't classify it as pain.  I actually kind of like swapping to a new tray to feel the pressure and know that my teeth are actually moving.This has been my experience as well! New trays are uncomfortable for me for only about 10 minutes, and then I guess I get used to them. I haven't had any trays that were unbearable at all and I'm 5 months in. The worst part is how long my teeth cleaning routine is every night ‚ and having attachments on all of my teeth is annoying, but that's more of a cosmetic annoyance than anything else. It's really such an easy experience for me. I don't brush or floss after *any* meal, just swish with water and pop my trays back in. I went in for a teeth cleaning last month and had zero cavities and they said I was doing a great job...so... ‚·\\x8f¼\\x8dï¸\\x8fSame Im finishing up my first week and its an absolute breeze. And if this is the hardest week then great.Worst part of Invisalign to me is the attachments. Necessary but annoyingwhy do you find them annoying? I have them too except having them fall sometimes I don't see any problemFor example I have an attachment on every one of my top teeth. So at this point its like having braces with all the added bumps. Nothing invisible about them but oh well Im used to it and almost doneAhh, I have only 2 on the top and 4 on bottom, I didn't really care about visibility I chose invisalign because it's easier for the hygieneThanks so much for this. I am due to collect my first trays in 10 days time. At 55, I am nervous, but also excited that I might finally get the smile Ive always wanted. My hubby will prepare some softer food to begin with, and hoping I will be absolutely fine after a day or two. Fingers crossed \\x8f»I was nervous too during my first night, I did take Tylenol in case but the next day I was feeling very minimal pain. I really hope you get a positive experience! I waited for so long to get Invisalign and I really don't regret my decisionThank you. I am hoping my experience is a positive one too. Really good to know you dont regret doing it.Im 70 years old and just finished 43 out of 43 trays. I always wanted pretty teeth and now have them. The trays never hurt in the beginning. Later they often hurt a little  the first two days after a tray change. My Otho wants me to wear my retainer trays fir 15 hours a day for 3 months before switching to only overnight. HVing trouble figuring out when to where them.Thank you! Due to some scheduling mishaps, I got my aligners two days before I flew to Coachella. I was so terrified after I found this sub that Id made a terrible mistake, but it was fine. Honestly, barely noticed. Carried mouthwash and floss picks, got a PUL tool (idk why everyone doesnt use them ” lifesaver), carried on as normal. \\n\\nIm only in month one but its really been a breeze. The attachments kinda bothered me, but it was just like an itch, and Ive gotten used to them. I took ibuprofen when I switched to my second aligner, and either that worked or it was a placebo effect. Do it, yall.I just dont understand why its so hard to put on retainers for people. I get that depending on how much movement is happening, some people get more pain but it always gets better, there is Tylenol and like\\n\\nIve seen people say they wish they got traditional braces.\\n\\nPeople would rather have metal.\\n\\n\\nAttached.\\n\\nTo their teeth.\\n\\n\\nThan to wear plastic retainers.\\n\\nBruhI understand the desire to reassure people, but pain is a very individual experience. Some people are more tolerant to it than others. My teeth discomfort was pretty significant and I did have trouble eating at the beginning and sometimes throughout the treatment on the first few days of a new tray. There were also really bad headaches. Dismissing the reports that people post as just œpeople want to complain and get comforted\\x9d is not helpful to new people who may go into it thinking they will be fine but turns out they struggle with it more.The point of the post is not to minimize anyone's pain, it's only to help others who are scared of Invisalign based on the posts that are in this sub. When I joined this sub before getting my first tray, I was truly terrified and then I realized that few ppl talk about how positive/easy it can be. I'm not trying to dismiss ppl, but to encourage ppl that may feel like it's not worth it because so many ppl share their bad experiences compared to the ppl that share mainly positive onesFair enough. Thank you for taking the time to respond and provide additional clarification. Looks like the post is providing lots of conversation and hopefully it will help prospective œInvisaligners\\x9dmake the best decision for themselvesNo one is dismissing people who experience pain from Invisalign. This is a subreddit where people share experiences. And a lot of those are shared people who struggle with pain. \\n\\nHowever, I couldnt agree with OP more, and dont know why youre dismissing their experience.I agree. I've gotten migraines for years and expected major pain. (fingers crossed that they are less after I'm finished with Invisalign because my job will be in better alignment and that will take pressure off) \\n\\nI think I used Tylenol for maybe the first week but it wasn't bad at all.  I've had way worse pain just living my life …My first tray was so bad that I didnt think I could continue. Its much better now, but occasionally I will get an aligner that really hurts.Honestly its been way too easy so far and im 45 trays in. \\nNo trayminder app, no keeping track of time, no issues at all really other than that ive had to change/remove certain foods from my diet. \\n\\nChewing gum is out which is quite obvious but habits like snacking became less favourable which in itself isnt a bad thingI love the happy posts. Ive made one too, I dreaded starting Invisalign because I thought I wouldnt be able to enjoy myself. I thought Id be in miserable pain. None of that has happened. I know everyones experience is different but I expected it to be much worse, especially because I have some serious crowding as well. . Of course some discomfort is expected, we have plastic trays forcing our teeth into new places after x amount of years, but nothing like some of these posts Ive seen. I empathize with those in pain but Im also very blessed and lucky to be on the mild discomfort side with you, interweb stranger !I could not agree more with this comment! So glad someone said it. I have just finished after 14 months. There was very little pain - just a slight bit of discomfort at the beginning. The first few times taking the retainers out was anxiety-inducing - but you get the hang of it fast and then it's easy. Take a mini cleaning kit out with you - toothpaste, floss, tooth brush, etc - so it's easy to sort your teeth out when you eat out. I agree with what someone else said to - if you keep your goals in mind then the minor inconvenience is absolutely worth it. My attachments were removed yesterday and my teeth feel so smooth it's amazing. Good luck and don't hesitate to anyone thinking about it or worried - it's completely manageable, becomes a regular part of your life, and time flies.Yes! I have a little kit and I take it everywhere with me. I went on Amazon and the dollar store to built it, it really doesn't need to be fancy or expensivePerfect! I did the same. I got a little pouch for a dollar or so at Ikea and took it everywhere with me - including hiking and camping!Agree with this wholeheartedly! I have just been scanned for retainers and had pretty much the whole hog with Invisalign: elastics, attachments on all teeth, extensive IPR, bonding. \\n\\nMy experience as a whole was extremely positive. Im not going to lie, IPR is not exactly enjoyable but in terms of pain it was way down at a 2/10. The same with the aligners. Im super lucky as I had pretty much no rubbing (maybe thats due to tolerance from having metal braces about 15 years ago?). The only painful aligner for me was the second after a lot of IPR, other than that there was just a bit of aching for a few days. \\n\\nI was terrified when I started due to all the horror stories but Im SO glad I went with it anyway. Everyone is different but it was 100% worth it. Also dont buy loads of gadgets, but I would highly recommend an orthokey tool.Amen. I completely agree. \\nI did have elastics, they were a pain to get in at first, but once you master the technique they were so easy to pop in and out. \\n\\nIm a bit of a rebel and only wear my trays for approx 16hours/day - Im tracking along, orthodontist hasnt questioned my wear time at all \\xadHonestly I don't even count the hours ¡ I simply eat and roughly an hour after I put them back in and everything has been tracking nicely. As a uni student, I go out at least once a week and have them off for like 8 hours or something and so far, it hasn't been a big deal/ lead to tracking issues. Ppl think too much imoIm still unsure if I want to go forward. Ive tried telling my dentist I dont want to have attachments on my front teeth and they refuse to listen to me. Its ridiculous that I havent even heard what my treatment will be until I go in to get the trays. Very frustrating. All my trays are ready, and Im sure they plan to put attachments on my front teeth. Guess Ill be walking outAny particular reason why you don't want attachments on your front teeth? I have at least one attachment on most of my teeth and two attachments on my upper front tooth. You can't really see the one in the front and they don't bother me at all when I eat. Honestly the rear molar ones are more annoying because they sometimes pinch my cheeks when I eat. First week they felt like someone glued gravel in my mouth. A week later they feel much better. I'm hoping they continue to smooth out.Both of my front teeth are porcelain crowns. I just really dont feel comfortable with attachments being there and Ive tried to make this known to the dentist. Also I really dont like how they look. That sounds petty, I know, but I do think theyre noticeable and Ive already gone through 4 years of metal braces when I was younger. It makes me crazy that Invisalign doesnt even tell you about attachments before getting the trays in. The only reason I learned about them is from scouring this subreddit to find more info. When youve gone years of wanting Invisalign not knowing that attachments exists, its really annoying that you finally can afford to get it and they act like attachments are no big deal. And maybe they arent a big deal to most people, but its unfair that they seem to hide them until its time to glue them.I had this same concern because I have 4 porcelain crowns in my mouth and a fair amount of fillings on the sides of my teeth. I asked a lot of questions before I let them put them on. I was also not told about attachments,  just that I'd need rubber bands prior to paying/signing up. This is what they told me. They put a different material on porcelain crowns because they don't want to damage the crown. She also told me that when they go to remove the attachments they use a special drill that will only remove the composite material and use a black light after to make sure they remove all of it when your treatment is done. I've also got rubber bands so I'm not getting away with someone noticing I've got something going on in my mouth. I asked them WHY the attachments are necessary and she said it just gives retainers a little more torque to move your teeth. That they are basically the braces of invisilign. Anyway, I don't know if this helps your situation at all, but don't hesitate to ask a ton of questions. If they aren't answering your questions I'd see if you can transfer to another Ortho. I'm doing invisilign to save my front teeth. I've got a misaligned bite from wearing an over the counter night guard.My first week was really rough, but it's been 5 months since, no issuesI agree its not that bad!  Pain is tolerable and goes away after 3 day per new tray. No biggie.Yeah I definitely didnt need to buy that wax and a travel tooth brush lolIve never had an issue with them even from the get go, its been so manageableSimilar experience - it's more of an inconvenience than anything else (I'm about 6 weeks into treatment).Couldn't agree more! A bit of an inconvenience, the constant brushing and flossing does get a bit much but I found once I got into the routine it was easy enough to get used to. I'd really encourage anyone who's sitting on the fence to go for it.I've been wearing mine for 25 weeks and get literally no pain on my weekly changes, and I barely wear my aligners for 15 hrs (ãƒ»_ãƒ»;)I havent had any pain: nothing like braces when I had pain from really sharp wires poking into my cheek. The only thing I had was catching my cheek at the back when I put my trays on for the first few days. \\n\\nMy trays change every 7 days so I dont worry about staining. I rarely brush them and just rinse them and chuck them into the Dentalpod ultrasonic cleaner that I bought. Taking the trays off can be a pain sometimes so its worth having an Orthokey. \\n\\nI use an interdental brush instead of floss because its much easier and quicker. I learnt on this forum to brush after instead of before breakfast so that I only have to brush once. \\n\\nOne attachment fell off in the first week and another fell off in week 3. Im just going to have them replaced at the next appointment in week 5.i agree. invisalign, for me at least, is definitely preferable to braces. its less painful and, of course, you can eat normally. the only thing i would say sucked is that if youre going to get rubber bands in the future, your slingers will have these hook-like things at the top and bottom of the sets. the ones on the top are kinda painful at first, because they dig into the inside of your lip. but after some days, your mouth gets tougher, and it doesnt hurt as much.Im on my tray 3 /20, no significant pain yet. Do you have experience with chewies? My orthodontist did not mentioned them but I just found out about them and wondering if I should get some to try. Do they really help?I did get chewies and used them in the beginning but k stopped because it fell into my toilet and I never replaced it. Since the little incident, I went to my orthodontist twice and he said my tracking was excellent. So truly, idk how good the chewies are since I'm doing good without themThen I dont think I need themWow thank you!Id say it likely depends on the exact treatment required. If your teeth barely need to move, of course it wont hurt as much. If your teeth have larger movements they need to make such as twisting or closing a gap, it will likely be more painful. \\n\\nI am on tray 38/46, and my most painful tray is the one Im wearing now. I had a significant gap between my front teeth that was also flared outward when I started. Since then the flare has been mostly handled as the teeth closed together. \\n\\nAs of this tray, however, that gap between the two front teeth is becoming negligible, to the point where the gums that *used* to sit between those teeth is getting very tightly squeezed to close it, to the point of severe inflammation and bleeding. The bleeding is enough of a problem that taking my aligners out these past few days have led to a very foul taste behind those two teeth thats a bit like if I had to imagine what rusty iron tastes like. Putting my trays back in, the first two days, would start the bleeding all over again. It seems my teeth just *really* dont want to close that gap, so this tray has been more of an issue than others. I had to use orajel just getting the trays in to reduce the pain. \\n\\nAnd its not just bleeding gums. The first two days of having this tray in were accompanied by a constant dull stinging sensation in those two teeth along with sinus pressure, which led to a more severe headache than usual. I can attribute it to the trays because when I took them out to eat, the pressure vanished, and no stinging sensation at all. Thankfully, on day 3 now, this has cleared up. \\n\\nAll that said its still very mild discomfort. It sounds bad on paper when someone talks about the kind of pain or symptoms they might have with Invisalign, but for those lurking and feeling anxious: keep in mind that in the vast majority of cases, even those reporting severe discomfort have that discomfort clear up within 2-3 days of starting a new tray, and Ibuprofen or Tylenol is usually enough to dull it. \\n\\nDont let fear of a few days of pain keep you from the smile youve been wanting all your life. Its absolutely 1000% worth it, and I would do it all over again if I had to, and Im not even done yet.Jesus, the gums do sound painful. My bottom teeth were pretty badly crooked with twisting movements. That was the aligner that hurt the most, when the tooth with the major problem started to move. I definitely agree it depends on your treatment and when the problematic teeth are getting a lot of movementTotally agreed! \\n\\nThe first tray SUCKED. I was so worried I was going to be at that level of pain the entire time, but by the fourth tray it really wasnt bad. Im on tray 19 now with 10 day changes and its become a breeze. The pain in minimal, maybe slight discomfort on tray change day. Theyre easier to remove now (omg the first tray I was sure it was never coming out), and the routine of brushing after eating is habitual. \\n\\nAll in all it IS annoying to deal with but so incredibly worth it.I think the hardest part for most people is that you do have to change your eating/drinking habits significantly if you're a snacker/grazer. I needed to lose some weight anyway, so I just embraced the Invisalign diet. It's very effective. No snacking and only drinking water except for meals. If that sounds terrible to you and you don't want to do it, braces might be a better option. With braces you can continue snacking and drinking things other than water, but they're also a lot more annoying when it comes to teeth cleaning, and painful. I had braces when I was a teenager and I'd take invisalign any day.Dis you have any attachments removed?  That's what I'm afraid of.Sometimes it does really hurt in the beginning, especially if you have a ton of attachments. That does go away and becomes more manageable when figuring out how to take them off properly. Depending on the severity of your teeth, it is 100% worth it. If experiencing issues, look at youtube or talk to others and pretty much any problem can be solved. I'm so used to the aligners now that it feels strange without them, to be honest. I've had mine for a fairly long time, though.I 100% agree. I started with braces and they were HORRIBLE! I had them on for four months and decided to switch to Invisalign for an extra $1000. Best money Ive ever spent! I havent had any problems with Invisalign-especially compared to braces. I am a HUGE snacker and Invisalign forced me into being more mindful of what I eat. I have also been a nail biter my whole life and after treatment I havent ever bitten my nails again. I cant enough great things about Invisalign!One thing that made mine less expensive is that I don't care if they are absolutely perfect. I didn't want my mouth reshaped, what is that, palate extender? I just wanted my teeth straighter.  If I was still in my 20s or 30s I probably would have.  But being in my 60s I simply want straighter teeth.Sincerely thank you to everyone sharing here. Im on tray 1 and have been really struggling with pain and discomfort from elastics as well as frustration with the whole routine.

My top teeth are also bucked out some.  Sigh, I have a long road. wishing you the best on your journey!Thanks! Same to you!39 trays, 18 months, comprehensive treatment for roughly $7000 out of pocket. A lot of times the price will depend on individual providers and area you live in. I would shop around to get an exact estimate. Consultations are usually free. Also Id go with an orthodontist over a dentist!Thanks for the awesome tips ! ŽOn the Invisalign website there is a page where it lists all the providers and gives them a tier based on how many they have done. For me my dentist was cheaper than the orthodontist I eventually went with. I read about a few bad stories on here and wanted to make sure I went to someone who had a lot of experience. Good luck! I get my trays in two weeks and am looking forward to nicer teeth!Yay good luck to you tooDefinitely agree, mine is about the same price and went with an ortho. Similar amount of trays tooJust search this sub for \"cost\" and you\\'ll get some good recent posts with lots of answers!Thanks!!To be fair, most dental insurance doesn\\'t have any orthodontics benefit for anyone over 18. I lucked out, my wife\\'s does, so I got a huge deduction in cost. Initial price was 6300, insurer discount brought it to 4700 and the insurance coverage and prepayment discount reduced that to 2100. I added in a $500 retainer plan since they are so expensive to replace (it buys me 5 retainers, normally 250 to get a replacement). I have an FSA, so after I tapped that, I ended up paying roughly 600 out of pocketWow ®!! Show me your ways lolDelta Dental. Guess it depends on the Ortho... But my daughter went there for her braces, so we were well versed in their pricing. I\\'d been thinking about it for a while because my father did it in his 60s, so I finally bit the proverbial bullet and bought in.Out of pocket at my dentist\\'s office was about $5500, but I utilized my insurance, groupon(2k off), and pretax money through my fsa account to pay about $1500.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t have dental insurance, I would look through Groupon for promo offers through various dental offices. Look at their reviews and then get $1500-$2000 off and try to get the cost down to $3500-4000. And, if you like compounding deals/rewards like me, you can think of utilizing a cash back credit card to get another 1-5% off when you pay.Great tips!

I will definitelyMine was $5200~ and it was considered cosmetic, so my insurance paid none of it. My plan is a 2 year plan and my teeth arent that bad so I feel like my ortho kind of scammed me into getting a 2 year plan, but it is what it is thats what Im afraid of! Because I didnt have the best experience with my ortho when it came to my braces. So I guess Ill have to look around before making a decisionMan this should be illegal ”” like this is a lot of money were talking about if they decide to lie to us they only gave me 12 (3 months worth) of my 40 Invisalign and thats only one year so far. Two years is going to be like 80 trays and looking at my 12th tray (3 months in), its like its almost straight already \\x90 tbh Im no dentist but seeing how people who have extremely crooked teeth have 2 year plans while Im also here with a 2 year plan with teeth that arent even bad enough for it to not be considered a cosmetic treatment, its a little suspicious \\xad I wonder if you can change orthos ?The cost depends on many factors. Who is providing them, the complexity of your treatment, if youre able to pay for them straight out or setting up a payment plan. For me, they had a promotion where if I paid for the whole treatment up front theyd knock off 500. So I got my Invisalign for 5000. I had dental coverage but not for Invisalign so it was out of pocket too. Worth it. My journey was Initially 63 weeks long but now I just got 25 more trays.Wow so did they lower the cost??Yes. Was 5500 but I got it for 5000Good to know!!It depends on your area. I would recommend going to an orthodontist and not a dentist. Mine was almost $7000 and insurance took off $2000, so I paid $5000 out of pocket. Im on tray 17/40, so I will be doing it for about a year. You have to have a lot of self-discipline but I think its 100% worth it if you want straight teeth and can commit to it! A year isnt that bad in the grand scheme of things, and I think most people end up doing it for around a year. It took awhile to get used to but now its not so bad. :)Hows the pain level??the first week was the worst, it feels so weird and hurts a lot but I took ibuprofen and that helped a lot. Some trays still hurt in the beginning when I take them out but not nearly as bad. Overall, its really not bad after the first week or two.Thanks for the info!Ditto on going to an orthodontist - they will ensure:\\n1) you are a good candidate for Invisalign both aesthetically as well as functionally - braces can make things worse if you have short roots or receding gums \\n2) compare your options with traditional braces which some people wish they got after having Invisalign as its a pain lifestyle-wise to deal with the liners and eating etc. \\n3) provide more options as your treatment progresses - if your plan isnt tracking they can perhaps help with other tools like elastics etc that may speed up refinement trays if you are in the majority that need them, for exampleI have 29 trays plus whatever refinements I will need and the total cost was $4265. Im lucky because I do have dental insurance and they paid $1500 towards that. My journey will be 15 to 18 months. I am currently seven months in.Thats not bad5000You can enroll in dental insurance at any time in the US not just during open enrollment- but usually have a waiting period. You should get dental insurance, because you have to be cleared by a dentist to start orthodontics usually. Its not expensive compared to the cost of dental work out of pocket.All the dental plans I was looking up had no ortho coverage :( which one do you recommend?You should still get dental insurance because you will need to visit a dentist regularly as a part of your treatment whether or not they also cover ortho.Oh yes I do, every 6 months, never stated I didnt. I pay out of pocket since I was 18. Had extensive dental work as a child all out of pocket too. Typically dental insurance here will only cover cleanings once a year and X-rays.$6000, insurance didn\\'t cover it because I\\'m too \"old\" (mid-30s). 25 initial trays and (currently) 25 refinement trays; both with weekly changes. I\\'m almost at a year of treatment so far. I went through my dentist (not an orthodontist) and the experience has been great. Make sure you find a provider that will actually take the time to see you personally and will answer your questions, no matter how small.\\n\\nA lot of people will say to go with an orthodontist because they\\'re \"better,\" but I\\'ve seen enough horror stories about dentists *and* orthodontists, that you should just go with who makes you feel the most comfortable. yes Im definitely going to shop around53 trays, probably refinements 6kNice for 53 traysExcellent! I found a great deal at a family owned dentist!As others have said, it totally depends where you live and how complex your case is. My total cost will be $7,500. I made a $500 down payment, then monthly payments of $330. From reading this sub, that seems to be on the higher end, but I have a 24 month treatment plan in a high COL area.Lol yes Im hoping I dont need as many trays6k , I had comprehensiveIm seeing that a lot of people are saying œcomprehensive\\x9d Im sorry but what does that exactly mean?Comprehensive is a plan that doesnt have a set # of trays! Theyll start u off with a certain amount then as time goes on they can adjust the plan without charging you more (I think thats the jist of it)Lol oh okay thanks!!Jesus. And I though Â3k was expensive for my comprehensive case, all included (even refinements). 40 trays to begin with. Im doing it in Portugal (where Im from). UK and US are crazy expensive  I live in the UK and I got quoted nearly 5.5k for all inclusive but only for up to 12 months which I thought was ridiculous. Decided doing it at home was not only cheaper but gave me more reasons to travel back (my mum is very happy about this ‚). The orthodontist is also super experienced and personable versus the one where I live in the UK which I didnt even meet on my first consultation. ¡ lol yeah Its expensiveMy cost was $7800 before insurance. I have generally straight teeth but a deep bite.Wow \\xa0I also picked the #1 provider in an extremely expensive city haha4,500 after a small, paid in full discount. \\n\\nTreatment will take a year. About 7 months in. Diamond Plus provider. I live in VA.FL - $4995. $1400 down and $195/mo for 18 mo Right now I only have 18 trays so 36 weeks but im assuming they will add some more!

So itll technically be maybe 15-16 months when Im done.I\\'m in Raleigh, NC and got comprehensive for ~$5000 with insurance paying $1500 and a 3% paid in full with credit discount so ended up paying around $3300. Treatment is estimated between 12-18mo. I have a large gap between my front 2 teeth and some very minor crowding on the bottom so pretty straightforward case. Also using a Diamond provider.What is a diamond provider??Invisalign uses a ranking system that basically tells you how many Invisalign cases the provider does. In order to be diamond they have to do like 150 cases in 6 months. Diamond is the 2nd highest rank.I am in Thailand for the moment so I decided to do it here since I am staying longer. I have a small underbite and got 20 trays, price in one of the best dental office on Koh Samui - $2,400 (82.000 bath).Wow $5700 cash. Luckily had two years of maxed FSA that covered almost all of it.Nice ŠOh, and 47 trays of which Im on the 5th. They initially said 7 days changes, but after the first I asked if I could do 5 days and the ortho was fine with it. So far seems to be good. The last ~3 days of the week were easy so I wanted to cut ~3 months off my journey.Thats great good luck on your journey!I go Invisalign Lite in Bangkok which costs around $2300usd. And only 15 initial traysThats great!!Yep. I think the full treatment is about 4K there.\\nBut I luckily got away with just straightening my front teeth and should be done in 4months. Hopefully no refinementsAnd do you have to be in Bangkok the whole time?? Or do they just give you the trays up frontWell its a bit of a process. And Im traveling Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam over the next 9 months.\\nSo Ill get them and then head to Cambodia and travel around. They said possibly half way they would like to check on my progress, but also may get away with sending photos etc to them. And then once again at the end. To see if I need refinements and get my end retainers. \\nIm hoping I wont have to go back until the end. But worst case I just fly back to Bangkok for like a $50 flight. Still a lot cheaper, and I can get my teeth sorted while traveling around. \\nBut from the consultation to getting the trays its probably around 6 weeks. Go in and get a consult and get your teeth scanned. A week later they have the plan back and you go in agree with it and see how your teeth will end up. And then another 4 weeks for Invisalign to make the trays and send them to Bangkok.  Give or take a few weeks, nothing certain.All the numbers in your comment added up to 69.

Just closing gaps.Wow ®I paid around $7500 CAD no insurance! My journey was about 13 months! About 30 trays!I am in Germany and I am paying 8000‚¬ for 2 years of Invisalign. I find the cost is more affordable in USA(I always thought it was more expensive there)Lol wow!! Yeah I would think thatSo one thing that is important to discuss with ur dentist is any additional costs such as composite bonding. I finished my invisalign treatment and yes my teeth are straight but if u have little chips etc it will need the bonding to give u that perfect smile that i imagine you are expecting if consiering paying all that money.Thanks for the tip!!Mine is around $5200-5300 (not in the states, so Im not sure about the exact amount.)\\n\\nFirst-time payment is around 1500, Then 430 for 10 times. \\nComprehensive plan, free scan and free retainer. Bi-weekly change.I was quoted 15-18 months, 23 initial trays and my first round of refinements has 27 trays. Not sure if Ill need another round of refinements after this or if Id do them even if suggested. I paid $4,500 at a platinum provider and can pay an additional $500 at any time to get lifetime retainer replacements at $30.5500 for me but my orthodontist flat rates everyone the same. Insurance is paying in 1000 per calendar year of treatment, and I\\'ll be in them for about a year and a half.$7,200. Insurance is paying 2k of it. I live in NY and I will be getting the hybrid treatment which is a carriere appliance first, Invisalign and then braces. They said if I just wanted braces and not Invisalign, its like 400 dollars less. Im hoping Invisalign will fix most things so that the metal braces wont have to be worn long but they said Invisalign might not fix everything, with my teeth specifically, which is why I need both.I live in SW Ohio. My Ortho\\'s charge for a full course of Invisalign would be $6400. Because he is a preferred provider of my insurance he can only charge me $5000. My insurance will pay $2000 , so I\\'m left with $3000. I paid $1200 down and have $78 monthly payments.Thats not bad! What dental insurance do you have??MetLife PDP through an employer. After emailing with MetLife, I believe they calculate the maximum in-network charge based on the area in which you live. I\\'m in a low COL area, so your mileage may vary.Comprehensive treatment, roughly $5,800. I got a $500 discount for paying in full and $500 discount for seeing their ad/saying that when I called to schedule. Im at 2.5 years now and will *hopefully* be done in 6 weeks.Hopefullyy lolIreland. Im paying ‚¬3,700\\nThats 18 months too. I have/had a weird bite too.comprehensive 3900$ for meWow what area??I paid $5900 CDN. I\\'ve heard there are providers that do it for as low a $3000, but I wanted to go with a platinum/diamond provider for confidence about the end result.\\n\\nI paid $1k upfront, and the Ortho offered ficing for the remainder (0% interest, fair monthly payments). My only regret is not having done this sooner.5500$ in Canada for comprehensive\\nStarting with 27 trays plus refinements$6,500 insurance did not pay a dime for me but 100% worth itI\\'m in the midwest...

Im in Texas tooI have MetLife FED Dental - High optionThanks!$5000 might be able average ballpark from people I\\'ve talked to (large east coast metro area). At my ortho office, the price was the same with regular braces, so there was not really a cheaper option. Dental insurance generally does not cover orthodontic work for adults unless you have super awesome coverage. And even the coverage I have for my kids is limited to $2000 „ My office offers an interest free payment plan option, I think that is very common for this type of medical office. They are used to having everyone pay out of pocket. The consult was free, so if you can do that, you can get the info to decide and not lose anything. Good luck!Mine has been $2500, BIL started my treatment at cost and Ive switched to a local orthodontist to finish my treatment.Wow thats very good!Im in the Midwest. My plan is 14 months with weekly changes for $6500. Fortunately my insurance is paying $2500 and I can just pay the rest with small monthly payments.Mine was 5,400 without insurance and insurance took off $1,000 so I\\'m paying 152 a month. I thought it was a great deal considering that I have 40 trays, they\\'re going to whiten my teeth when I\\'m done, and I\\'ll have 5 years of unlimited retainers after my treatment is overThats awesome actuallyYeah, i did it with smile doctors orthodontist, maybe you could check if there\\'s one near you, good luck with your smile bruv!‘ŒThanks same to you!!Mine was $5200 without insurance! One year! Payments every monthMine was around $4,000. I had a $800 off coupon with the office for being a first time patient. I put $2,000 down cash then $275 a month for 6 months. Also I dont have insurance so all this is out of pocket.Wow!! I need to see if dental offices around me have specials going onDefinitely look around and call and ask!My dental insurance does not cover adult orthodontics. I paid $5980 for comprehensive. I maxed out my FSA+put a little more down. My payments are 200/mo x 14 mo plus the FSA out of my paycheck.Got a $9456 quote. Am I getting ripped off?® umm yours is much more expensive compared to everyone else?! I wonder why? How many trays do you have to do and what area are you in?Hi. In Sydney, Evolution Orthodontics in Blacktown. Not too sure, it doesn\\'t say on the quoted paper.Id say get a different quote from somewhere else to compareWill do!I am in tbe UK. I got a quote from 2 places, one was just under 10k. Absolute pisstaker of a guy. He didnt even scan me himself, he just looked at my scans and pics and then arranged a meeting with me at 10pm on Easter fucking Sunday on Zoom.  He negged my posture, my face and all sorts of shit in order to convince me to give him my money.  The next day I went to a different dentist and got an immediate quote in writing for 3.5k for the exact same treatment. I paid an extra 300 to have a wisdom tooth out. I\\'ve had to pay the 3.5k within a year otherwise the price would go up, so about 300 a month for a year.  Also because I signed up during covid I had 1k knocked off (it was originally 4.5k).  A lot of places had this same deal during covid for some reason. Is it me or did everyone suddenly get teeth straightening ads?\\n\\n\\nI had about 30 trays that lasted about a year and then was rescanned and and have another year of trays, due to a double crossbite. My teeth look pretty good and the bite is much better, it definitely has improved my over all attractiveness. Can\\'t wait until the final results, definitely worth doing.  I think start to finish, my treatment plan is 2.5 years which is kind of funny because my teeth never actually looked that bad.  I see some really crazy teeth in this sub and they are straight in under a year just because they have a different bite.Wow!! Its sad that medical professionals try to take advantage of people smh. But Im glad you got a different opinion!! Ill definitely get different quotes from different orthosYeah thanks. This guy owns a couple of dental practices, one of which is on my high street so I know he is raking in the cash.  My dental practice now is so much quieter and they are so lovely and accommodating.  Shop around if you don\\'t like the first quite you get.Thanks!!Quoted for $3299. Can pay $299 for 12 months.I will be starting in a few weeks and will be paying about $6,250 to align my teeth and help with my bite (underbite). My treatment is 24 months, attachments, elastics, retainers, and any other refinements as required for up to 5 years. Honestly, that sounds like a lot but IMO it\\'s not that much if you look at it as a lifetime investment to improve your dental health and boost your confidence.

Did they not use the plastic guards to pull your lips away?No, just bare fingers (with gloves on), and straight up sanding away … I guess my dentist and their assistant are savage.I wanted to add to the group of people saying that this is so unfortunate but definitely not everyone\\'s experience. I was SO NERVOUS for IPR and it ended up not being big deal at all. I was lucky and only had it in 3 spaces, but it was quick and painless.Eek, sorry this happened to you :( I guess Im lucky that I didnt have this experience with IPR. The worst part for me was the noise and thinking that my tooth could fall out due to all the pressure they used.The ipr, to me, just felt cold. The removal of attachments on the other hand. Wtf, I swear they were breaking my teeth with those scrapersUgh, this was the worst for me. I wasn\\'t expecting it at all in my appointment, I thought it was just getting it put on and general info, care, etc.. like getting a bite guard. But no - \"surprise, we\\'re filing 5 of your teeth!\" I can\\'t sand stuff, I can\\'t even file my nails. It\\'s literal nails on chalkboard for me. Having that in my mouth was the absolute worst thing I have *ever* had done at the dentist.\\n\\nFor your lip - use Aquaphor. Keep it wet all day, might need to reply 4-5 times throughout the day until it heals (travel size bottle is great, I found the chapstick formula to be less effective). I didn\\'t have this issue with Invisalign, but I recently did accutane which dries the everliving hell out of your skin and lips, and I got cracks like this sometimes. Aquaphor was a life saver.same I dont know why they didn\\'t give me a heads up before it? It was a complete surprise for me toothanks! I already have aquaphor at the ready for other things (bug bites), but this def help out with my cut.\\n\\ndef didnt expect the cut to be so traumatic but we learn! Hope everyone reading can understand that this isnt a universal experience and could have been avoided with extra knowledge and preparation.\\n\\nRequest a mouth guard! Ill do the same next time for mine ´I had ipr done in 5 places and the used an oscillating diamond plated head. It didnt hurt at all, just got a little warm. They also didnt cut me.Same here. 1 minute to saw 5 spaces. East peasyThats very strange. They didnt shave with strips, they used an automated tool / saw on mine. It was over in a few seconds. Just want to share for anyone that might be scared: Ive had IPR six times and never once have had it hurt or bleed. Unfortunately, I think this is an anomaly.they cut my gums with it and it bled a lot :/ not funMy IPR sessions (both the little strips and the mini power sander) were pain and blood free.It sucks that happened. When I had mine done, my dentist used a teeny tiny little die grinder. Didn\\'t hurt, just felt weird and the tooth dust tasted like how pencils smell. It was all done in a matter of seconds.\\n\\nI have had the metal file thing you had when it came to smoothing spots after fillings, so I know how unpleasant it can feel!Everytime I got IPR, I would constantly have blood in my mouth, so I feel your pain!Im so sorry! UG!Eek. I had IPR several times up into the gums between my teeth. I couldnt handle it and had to have local anaesthetic injectionsSo sorry  \\nWeird but I actually enjoyed getting it between my front teeth bc it really helped with the tightness. It was strangely satisfying!! \\nNot satisfying were all the cuts and bloody moments from by band hooks rubbing gums..Did they not use the mouth spreader thing?! That dremel shouldnt have been anywhere near your lipsNo  I wish they would. Next time imma request a mouth guard because that experience is so traumatic. Gum bleeding kinda fine, but lip corner, not so much I really hated IPR! The vibrations really got to me in the worst possible way.And the sound! Ugh They WHAT :0This happened to me too at the beginning µ\\x8d’¬My IPR was extremely sensitive and painful. They did not cut my lip but my dentist uses a high speed hand piece with a burr to do the IPR so I think that contributes to the pain. He does smooth it after the hand piece with the serrated strip and that doesnt hurti always ask for vaseline \\n\\nits helpfulThis almost happened to be because I could feel where the strip was even with a numb mouth. Luckily stopped them and said dont you cut my lip\\n\\nEdit: sorry this happened to you that sucksyour dentist can use an ARS bur and IPR key which is much quickerThis is not normal. I had quite a bit of ipr, never felt it and certainly never got cut! So this is not inevitable,  this is an errorI had IPR done a few times throughout my treatment and they always sanded my teeth up too high towards my gum line and made my gums bleed a time or two.  easily the worst part of the whole Invisalign experience.', 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'tray time management', 'financial concerns', 'oral hygiene', 'facial appearance'], 'scores': [0.2422364354133606, 0.22063028812408447, 0.12102949619293213, 0.11326706409454346, 0.11160317808389664, 0.10631554573774338, 0.08491802215576172]}, {'sequence': \"Getting prepared for starting Invisalign next week - these are my starter travel essentials!Definitely stock up on the lip balm, more floss, and travel mouthwash bottle (you can refill from the larger bottle as needed). \\n\\nLove the case!Hand sanitizer for cleaning your hands before touching your mouth, and after for the sake of society Yes definitely, I have one usually but will be bringing an extra in here!Can tell you're from the UK by the toothpaste tube style.Its my favourite!

I use my electric toothbrush morning and night but just brush gently with a soft bristled brush after lunch.No way? Do you think it was the type of toothbrush you were using, that it was too hard? Or you were brushing too often?Always use a soft bristle tooth brush. Anything else will eventually cause recession. Brush 2-3 times a day as usual. You dont have to brush every time you eat something. Just rinse/swish with water before your trays go back in.I thought I was a crazy person for brushing the normal amount per day. Get the gunk out if theres leftover but for the most part it seems like more brushing will do more harm than goodAll of the above lol.

Both genetics + hard brushing got me here.White foam!!! Found on Amazon. Its a foam you squeeze into your aligner and then put it on. The foam whitens your teeth and your attachments.

Congrats for the start to you as well !!Ive had issues since a night guard gave me the open bite. There is a constant tension in my face. Really hoping Invisalign can bring us some relief from some of these issues. I think it will!I have seen extreme transformations far more problematic than an open bite so I am hopeful for us !!! I am over 10 years without having a normal bite closing position...I don't even remember what it feels like to close my mouth...it is a nightmare !Its going to feel great when it closes. And hardships make people grow!  While it completely sucks, youll come out the other side with an appreciation for little things that could otherwise be taken for granted! Good luck dude!Same for\\nYou mate !!! Lets keep in touch!I'm in the exact same boat as you! I have TMJ issues and also my bite Is getting worse as we speak. And when I speak my molars touch which prevents me to speak properly as of the last few months. I'm getting my first tray next week. Hopefully it all turns out well with you and it relieves the TMJ issues you haveFeel so good not be alone and just the fact to share with somebody else make me feel so much better!!

When I go in for checkups, I see the hygienist, and rarely the orthodontist. In fact, for the last 2 years I've only seen the hygienist.  They do my rescans,  set me up when the trays come in, and then deside where the elastics should go. I'm nearing the end of my most recent set and my bite is still not lining up. The hygienist have finally asked the orthodontist to chime in on my treatment.  They've changed my elastic positioning twice and still my bite is not closed. They insist on fixing this with elastics to finish me up. Do you think my bite can be fixed with elastics alone or should I request another rescan? I'm fine with continuing treatment, I paid $6800 to fix my teeth and I want them done properly.  I'm worried they're just trying to get me out the door where I've been a patient for so long. Photos in comments.If you're following best practices, it sounds like you need to get a consult with another orthodontist or two. Don't give them information at the beginning of the appointment that will cause them to lean away from being objective. Just the fact that you're trying to close your bite and your current orthodontist hasn't been able to. Don't mention their practices or how long it's been until they give you their input. Then once you have their initial response, let them know your orthodontist is rarely involved and it's been 5 years without successful treatment. You may have to pay more to elongate your treatment (and switch orthodontists), but it doesn't sound like yours is going to fix it.5 years!? I never heard anyone being in treatment for 5 years. My treatment is not even one year through and I am already anxious for it to end. Can you post a before picture? I dont get why it is lastimg for 5 years\\nI have to say, to me your teeth look finished.Here's a [Before & After](https://imgur.com/a/RUPPwdy) showing the first 4 years (upto 2021). Thanks. They look finished to me too, but my teeth don't touch when I bite down. Cosmetically I'm happy with them, but I also want my bite to be aligned so I dont have issues with my jaw in the future.Omg! My teeth were worse than yours but similar. Im 37/40 Im so sick it it already! Youre a trooper!!I still dont get why it is lasting 5 years. My teeth were far worse, and they look ok now after 9 months. I am now on my first refinements round, they are working on my bite now. You are a trooper like the other commenter said.\\nYour bite looks good to me, just seems like the back teeth are not touching, but that seems to be a common thing from the thickness of the aligners, they will probably settle when you dont wear the aligners all the time in the retainer phase. But I am no ortho, so just guessing. Good luck! Š[deleted]Haha yeah....I'm so over it!5 years is very long but Im not sure what your starting point was? My understanding is a posterior open bite can be a relatively common side effect of having clear aligners. It should be fixed but its not unheard of. My ortho opted to treat mine by cutting my top aligners so they dont cover all of molars, he explained my molars would settle. My past 3 aligners have been this way and my open bite is almost completely closed now. I do think other orthos try to use elastics to achieve this, it really depends on the case I guess. Then there are some Ive seen on here who recommended finishing with traditional braces because of this issue.\\n\\nI would ask to speak to the ortho again directly and ask if elastics is the only way to achieve closing the open bite or if they have another recommendation. \\n\\nI know this doesnt help, but just as a side note, your teeth look phenomenal other than the open bite!Thanks so much. Im really pleased with them cosmetically.  I just wish I could be done with them but the bite is still off. My teeth were crooked but I really don't think they were that bad. Everything was straight except for my two front teeth and they had initially said 18-24 months for treatment. I may ask about traditional braces on my next appointment. This is just getting out of hand ya know? [Before](https://imgur.com/a/RUPPwdy) photosI was about as many years in before my dentist referred to an orthodontist for lack of progress. \\n\\nOrtho said case was too complex for Invisalign and result was metal braces for 12 months, thankfully at a discount given the circumstances. \\n\\nDont regret either option, especially in the masked world of CovidI may request metal braces after this round if thats an option. They had said that I was a candidate for both options,  so I went with the less visible one as I was getting married the next year. At this point, I don't really care about the appearance lolTime for a second opinion.\\nYour hygienist is fucking up and your Ortho is milking it.[Photos of my bite](https://imgur.com/a/UUA0xGA)I would switch to traditional braces if I were you.

Those softwares they use to generate treatment plans are quite complex.\\n\\nAlso a pressed plastic splint alone can\\'t do all the movements needed for orthodontics, that\\'s why proper treatment done by orthodontists often include sticking little hooks and wedges on the teeth to facilitate the force delivery.I vaguely saw he worked with an ortho for the plan in a comment. He\\'s currently selling a video tutorial for other people to DIY their aligners but there\\'s a lot of proof coming out saying it\\'s a scam.This reminds me of that trend of the little tiny rubber bands that you\\'d stick on your teeth to close gaps. A friend of mine did that and both of her teeth fell out in the middle of dinner one night. It was insane. And then she tried Smile Direct, no attachments of course. Her back molars misaligned and one had to be extracted.\\n\\nSo personally, seeing how perfect my invisalign journey went and ended... No thanks. His way of doing this video may seem innovative but it\\'s actually quite dangerous. To make trays for people, not knowing their oral health status or previous history is awful. I can\\'t imagine he\\'d offer to make them relatively cheaper than more affordable aligners out there.Holy fuck.My time is worth way more. But I guess If its WWIII and I need more trays then this is the guyOMG I laughed SO HARD! He spent thousands on his 3D printer and heat machine. He wears those home made trays and his teeth start falling out 1 out 10 dentists recommend using homemade alignersIts not polypropylene plastic that an orthodontist would use, its just regular plastic which makes it less reliable as a retainer. Nice try thoughYeah, this should end well\\n\\nYou can make your own pacemaker tooPutting resin in your mouth for an extended period of time sounds like a great way to get cancer\"Invisalign is expensive\", you know... as someone who has been in Invisalign for almost a year now, I always get tired of that phrase. Dental work of all kinds is not cheap, with or without insurance. You\\'re paying a professional dentist/Orthodontist to FIX your teeth. \\n\\nI had a talk with one of my friends about this literallyu yesterday, cause she said it was expensive. My teeth were jacked up (I have my before and after photos of what they look like now on my page). Like, so is a car when you get one and make payments on it. Honestly, my treatment plan for a monthly basis is cheaper than my car note by $57. Yes, things are expensive when you\\'re getting COSMESTIC work DONE. But, no one wants to think that technically getting your teeth straightened is cosmetic work. Thats why most dental insurances don\\'t cover you after a certain age. \\n\\nAnyways, this guy scares me. I would never trust something like this.You know, I spent thousands of dollars on my teeth because I didn\\'t wanna have to figure out the science and go through all THIS effort on TOP OF the hassle that invisalign comes with. Y\\'all can go ahead and gamble with your time, money, and teeth. I\\'m perfectly happy coughing up the cash and letting professionals figure this out for me.Only about 100 ways this could go seriously wrong. Enjoy having to get traditional braces when youre done!Yeah thats cheaper buying all the shit. LolWhat concerns me here is that I know for a fact some of my teeth had to move \"the wrong way\" to make space in order to then be moved into their proper position, I fear someone who has not studied hella hard (close friend is a dentist, she had no life while in school) to be a dentist or an orthodontist has necessary knowledge to determine that.\\n\\nEven scarier at the end he was telling people he could do their trays.

I sat in that seat getting in between my teeth filed to create space for my moving teeth and  attachments put on that we all know helps to put pressure and move the teeth in a certain direction .. all this is going to do is cause major issues to peoples teeth probably gum recession.. if this is not done by a medical professional people should really stay away from a homemade tray..  sometimes we have to endure a big cost for things to be done properly.Hopefully he doesnt have periodontal disease. Yikes no noThis is pretty cool but what about the attachments?Thats the easy part.\\n\\nJust needs to get some dental bonding material and a curing light. Or superglue. Whichever is cheaper.I mean my ortho made mine in his office, after I was told it would be Invisalign. Now I cant get out or my credit will be screwed.\\n\\n\\nWhy the downvotes???Because people dont know what downvote meansDamnHes really talented, but the normal person who cant do this should always get retainers from a professional.This guy looks young and already knows a ton. If this dude went to college he\\'d probably be a killer ortho someday if he already knows this much. Obviously doing this is dumb but the fact he figured it out is still cool.This guy knows how to research!RIPRiskyHeyif he wants to do that, by all means. Lol not my thing though.Ur doneI think it\\'s sick afHe might get lucky and get a good result.\\n\\nI mean once upon a time we (dentists) used to suggest treating upper retroclined (tilted back) incisors could be achieved by holding a spoon in your mouth and putting pressure on the teeth to tilt them back. \\nOf course you need to keep that spoon in your mouth for several hours every day, so its not exactly easy.I...what.......no stop.How much did all the equipment cost??!Just no. Teeth are worth investing in IMOIf could end up being fine. Or you could end up irreversibly damaging your teeth.\\n\\nMy patients have done everything from file their own teeth with an emory board to doing real Invisalign to doing the SmileDirect junk. Some patients had a pretty decent result. Another killed her tooth and it ended up needing a root canal and a crown.\\n\\nSo if you are willing to risk killing some teeth or even worse, causing irreversible root resorption that will lead to losing teeth prematurely, then OK, go ahead.I mean, yeah, all you have to do is image the teeth, model the adjustments, apply the attachments, and 3D print the slingers. All youre really paying for is the expertise of knowing how to actually do all that „Im a sewist, but Im going to the ER for stitches every time. \\n\\n* unless I need to Macguyver something during the apocalypse.Scary.dont do this.

I never knew it, but apparently a narrow upper jaw and mouth breathing are linked not because of where the tongue sits, but because the upper jaw's wideness affects the size of the nasal cavity.It wasnt an AHA moment per se, but yes i have noticed a difference looking back :)Same here. I'm on tray 28 and realized that I can breathe more easily through my nose now.Yay im so happy for us :D I think a lot of people see invisalign as a cosmetic option a lot of the time, but for a lot of us its way more than that. \\n\\nIm thrilled for you, and it only gets better!Definitely. I'm doing this so I can actually chew my food.  The improved appearance is just the icing on top.Huge improvment!Thank you! I thought moving the back teeth and rotating teeth was the most painful part but moving these front teeth in the later stages has definitely kept me on my toes.\\n\\nStill a ways to go on the top but i have every faith they will be lovely when im done :D Im so happy! Still cant believe they are my teeth lolI am happy for you, we will soon get a perfect smileŠIt's magic isn't it, enjoy your new smile!Painful magic haha but yes! I know its probably a psychological thing considering i went so long with my teeth in the 'former' pic, but i still feel like my teeth are messed up? Like.. theyre not? My teeth arent even done and theyre straighter than a lot of people i know but i cant get my head past the feeling that my smile is jacked. \\n\\nDo you think that ever goes away?It will definitely go away. Wait until you dont have them at all and you can smile from ear to ear confidently!!!!Work with your othro and make sure you are clear about your goals - there will be refinement round(s) after your last tray to do just that - refine the final position. The first batch of trays is designed to get you roughly 80-90% of the way there. They look great!!Wwwwooooooowwwwww Im so happy for you ±¹Holy CRAP that's a lot of movement. Was it painful? I am having my bite moved, my teeth are straight and whatever but bite is right on top of each other so grinding has really done a number on my teeth, and I'm feeling some pain. I can't imagine what the movement you are having must feel like. \\n\\nFreaking awesome for you to get that new smile coming. Wow. Congrats!!Sometimes yes, very painful. I dont really have any comparison to the pain others felt haha but i think i got the maximum movement out of every tray possible so.. yeah there was pain. \\n\\nId say in order of pain.. back teeth were achey when moved laterally in any direction. Rotation of any teeth (and there was a lot of rotation in my teeth) was more painful. My front teeth are simultaneously being pushed outwards (my lateral incisors) and pulled inwards (central incisors), which is pain of a different kind because they're opposing forces happening at the same time in a very close area. Thats whats happening now and in the final 9 weeks and .. oof. I feel it. \\n\\nThere were also times my bite crossed when expanding my arch where i had the grinding and my teeth hit in ways that hurt. On those weeks i ate lots of smoothies and soups!Amazing my guy...I am now feeling like a whiner taking aleve with my relatively minor changes.aha no dont! Pain is pain. If you have something to stop the pain, take it. Suffering needlessly through any kind of pain doesnt gain us anything :)amazing!What a transformation. You must be so pleased!So you will only wear a top tray going forward? Or will you wear your last bottom tray from now on?\\n\\nI find when I take my Invisalign out and only have one tray in briefly it feels really weirdI called my ortho to ask about this because i too had no clue what i was supposed to do when im finished. I have 3 more weeks before my next ortho appointment so they advised me to wear this tray for 3 weeks (its gonna be gross, i already know). And then if im happy at the next appt they will remove my attachments and fit a permanent and temporary retainer. If i go that route ill wear the perm retainer full time for 6 months so ill still have both top and bottom with trays, just the top will be invis and the bottom retainer while i finish the top. \\n\\nThey also said if im not happy i can be rescanned for additional trays but im very happy with my bottom teeth. I dont know if they'll choose to rescan anyway, but im going into it with an open mind and hopefully i finish both on track and everything is all good!My Ortho said it's pretty much a given that everyone will have at least one set of refinements, no matter how well you track.  It's making the final adjustments needed. \\n\\nI just got rescanned for my second (and final) set of refinements. After the initial trays, my teeth looked good but my bite felt off. My refinements are adjusting that, and my teeth are almost perfect now. I love looking at them.\\n\\nHopefully if you do need refinements, they won't bum you out as you'll know at the end of it you will have your perfect set of teeth.I am ready for him to say i need them, but my bite has never felt better and my teeth are moving great but who knows! \\n\\nIf anything ill take having fewer attachments no matter how long it takes. I have them on *every* tooth except one back molar and frankly some of them are huge. I dont remember what my teeth felt like without them! \\n\\nThat'll be nice at least.That must be such a surreal feeling. You deserve all the confidence coming with your new radiant beautiful smile!Holy cow, this is IN-CRED-I-BLE !!!!  So cool what plastic can do, haha.  May I ask - did they have to remove any of your top teeth that were nestled behind or are they all moved?  Hard for me to tell being inexperienced at looking in mouths and teeth counting from that angle, haha.You may ask! So I actually had my 2 upper canines removed. My lateral incisors were the ones sat behind, the canines were where the incisors *should be* in the tray 1 picture. \\n\\nIt's apparently not that uncommon, I found out after my initial consultation and many tears about removing 2 healthy teeth that my boyfriend of 6 years, has no canines. He had them removed during his childhood braces. My ex, now a friend, also has no canines for the same reason. I've been up close and personal with both of those men and looked at their faces for hours and never ever noticed haha crazy what plastic AND braces can do!gosh, now I'm even more blown away!!  And you are correct - nobody will ever notice that the canines are incisors, haha.  I understand your being upset initially but so glad you had 2 people so close to you (um, wow!) that also don't have canines to help you realise it's no biggy.  I am mostly surrounded by people with perfect teeth so my misery is all my own, haha!Ah that's why community like this exists though! To show you you're not alone ºï¸\\x8f I'd never seen anyone In my life with teeth like mine. I've travelled to several continents and multiple countries and never seen anything like it. Then when I seriously started immersing myself in the online orthodontic community, I found 2! \\n\\nI'm the only one who went for Invisalign but still. Were out here for each other. \\n\\nYou're not alone I promiseYou're so sweet!  <3\\nI don't feel alone - some of them were just more ficially fortunate growing up and had theirs taken care of way back.\\n\\nI also thankfully have a great friend at work who is doing Invisalign right now as well!  But she and I are the only ones I know with teeth we don't like, lol.  I also don't worry too much about this kind of thing so I'm ok.\\n\\nYour attitude about it all is so stellar that I was more commenting on that as well as my surprise at all the non canines, haha.  I feel so sorry for the members of this sub who are letting this all get them down so much so it's great to see your amazing progress and amazing spirit to help them too!Ah you're sweet thank you! \\n\\nI get tired of it like everyone else though lol I've had a lot of pain and felt like I'd made the biggest mistake sometimes but Ive never hid how much I hated my former teeth and getting them fixed is truly one of the best things I've ever done for myself. Might even be the best thing! I'll let you know when I'm done haha \\n\\n And if I can help even one person feel a little bit inspired to keep at it then I'll flash my former shark teeth to the world if I have too. I was bullied relentlessly my entire life for how they were before, I don't want anyone to ever ever feel the way I did before again.\\n\\nMy dentist is the one who pushed me to work on my teeth and finally get braces, I think I shocked him when I walked into his office crying and begging him to please remove my teeth and give me dentures because I couldn't take it anymore. He didn't. He worked with me and stuck with me and inspired me to work through it. I saw him today actually to book my cleaning and he looked so proud of me. And here I am! If I can help even one person not feel what I felt before I walked into his office that day, it will all have been worth it :)I wish I could upvote more than once!!

However I finally got them today, and Im on the verge of having a panic attack. Why did I do this to myself? Why did I sign up for 15-18 months of this? I cant remember why I made this decision right now, all I feel is anxiety and intense self-hatred.You get used to it so quick!

I hope everything is ok, and I wish you the best for your Invisalign Journey!! \\x9dï¸\\x8fYeah it becomes second nature, honestly.what chloe said. its super uncomfortable and makes you want to rip out the aligner and quit right now. but give it a week or two and itll get a lot easier. im halfway through my trays and its almost second nature to use my aligners. \\n\\nim sorry its feeling really hard right now, and i wish i could do something to relieve that for you. please just try to be patient and itll get betterI like the pain of a new traysaaaameYep, 6 months in and they flew by.

I rarely brushed my teeth, never showered, the usual. With Invisalign and being forced to take care of myself everything improved a 7473882 % (including my mental health).\\n\\nStay strong these first days and dont surrender. Youll get through this.Same. I kind of needed a new routinesame it helped so much for the routine aspectI also had huge buyers remorse but that goes away within the first week or so haha.\\n\\nIts typical to think œoh shit what did I get myself in to?\\x9d \\n\\nIm now 7 weeks in and the difference in my teeth already is nuts, Im so happy and excited to finish out treatment TBH. Just hang in there. Itll get better trust me.\\n\\nMost of it is self guided as well, you swap your own trays etc. Metal braces wouldve been a much bigger commitment to the orthodontists office!Agreed. The first week, maybe first 2 weeks were the worst ones. After that, you barely notice them, except when you change out for the next set. That only is noticeable for like, the first day max. They\\'re really quite painless and nobody notices you wearing them. Back when I had mine in, my coworkers were always surprised to see me pull mine out at lunch. Literally every time they\\'re like \"oh yea I forgot you were doing that\".\\n\\nThey\\'re a small price to pay for a much more comfortable and aesthetically pleasing smile.Same - just over 3 months in and loving it now. It did take a while tho.I almost had a panic attack when they put the attachments on and I was freaking out the whole first week. But now Im really used to it! You got this :)The attachments were intense! That was a rough appointment for me too. Im super sound sensitive and it was torturous. Glad youre feeling better now!Oh no! Is it loud? Ill bring ear plugs if so”I usually always have a pair in my purse anyway, because like you, I hate noisy places and am protective of my hearing”and its paid off, as I have great hearing for my age.Applying them wasnt too bad it was when they shaped them and then later in the process the IPR was also terrible. Grinding/polishing sounds that felt like they were inside my head. I keep earplugs in my purse too! Im soooo sound-sensitive. And it doesnt help that my partner has the loudest speaking voice on the planet. I swear he has made my hearing worse lolUgh I know right? I had the same immediate reaction. But I stay focused on the outcome I want and how much better Ill feel about myself. Similar mentality to working out”I know I need to do it, some days its really hard to force myself to do it, and I almost always feel better about it. Im only a few months in but can tell you the œinconvenience\\x9d feeling fades quickly, it became second nature within a week. \\n\\nHang in there! Youre making a difficult but positive investment in your future.Thank you, I needed this motivation. Right now Im just hating myself a little because Im so uncomfortable, and feel like I just imposed this on myself. \\n\\nCant wait for the first week to be over *sigh*Just get through that first week. After that, youll be more comfortable with it and youll start seeing results. Itll be worth it!I disliked the strange uncomfortable feeling as well. I ordered some silicone sensory/toddler chews from Amazon. Chewing on those really help me. Ive had aligners for several months and now only very sporadically get that feeling.I\\'m on week 4. You get used to it. But you do tend to skip meals as you don\\'t want the burdenHey there, I felt the same way the day I got mine on. My teeth were mostly ok as I previously had braces, Im doing Invisalign only about 9 months, but when I walked out of the ortho office I was very upset, I got home and my wife was like how do you feel? And i said œdepressed.\\x9d Why did I do something so drastic thats such a big lifestyle change? My teeth were fine!!\\n\\nHowever, like some others have said, you quickly get used to it. Sure its an adjustment, but trust me, in 3 weeks or so you will be in the groove, and you also get to watch your teeth improve!\\n\\nHang in there and good luck!!Solid rhymeI felt the same exact way when I first started, literally had a panic attack and felt claustrophobic bc it felt so odd. But you get used to them I swear! It look me like 2 weeks, then I barely noticed they were in. Kinda becomes like second nature. Plus I feel like seeing your progress, moving to a new tray each week, and keeping up with my flossing and brushing actually helped me out so much. I also struggle with mental health, but I swear I would do invisalign all over again because Im so happy with the results :) you got this!I felt claustrophobic too!  I would need to remove them periodically and take a mini break and then put them back in. It took me 5 weeks before I had moments of them feeling so natural that I couldnt remember if they were in or out. Its nice to know that Im not the only one who felt claustrophobic.Been there done that lol. The first day was the worst for me. First day I was in denial. First week I regretted the whole decision. You need to get used to the whole transition. By the second week you will be fine. Just go out and do stuff, or go fix and clean something in the house. And when u see the change in your teeth you will start wondering why you didnt do it sooner. Im getting refinements and I cant wait to do a whitening session and be done with this. Good luck. Its 100000% worth it!I was miserable the first few days and was low-key pissed at my wife for talking me into doing it.  The pain goes away although there may be some discomfort with your teeth moving.  It really becomes a way of life and you feel strange when they\\'re not in.  \\n\\nTry to remember why you got that in the first place.  I know it\\'s hard at the moment but it absolutely gets better and you\\'ll be so happy with the results.I\\'m poor as hell, but I still dropped the 7k on mine. I\\'m on tray 38/50 right now, and I can tell you that I have no regrets. I feel so much more confident when I smile, and I know my teeth are going to be healthy for the rest of my life. You got this OP! It may seem scary at first but you\\'ll be thanking yourself in the future.suffer now (as in the first week or two) and live the rest of your life as a champion.You get used to wearing them quick, and look through some of the results here, they can move so fast and it will bring you so many benefits. \\n\\nMaybe reframe it as gratitude \"I am grateful that I get to fix my teeth/bite and that this system allows me to eat all and it\\'s so flexible. I\\'m grateful I get to engage in this treatment and that my brain is trying to take care of me in all areas\" riding the wave and acknowledging my feelings and reframing them as gratitude is what helps me when I feel anxious.\\n\\nAlso, remember your coping skills: deep breathing, journaling, gratitude, reading or watching something distracting, taking a shower. Remind yourself you are safe and that millions of people have done it and there is always an improvement. You got this.Damn good advice.Brilliant suggestions, thank youWhen I first got my Invisalign in my first thoughts were œoh yeah, I cant do this, no way\\x9d \\n\\nAnyway I have three trays left lolIt\\'s going to help your mental health in the long run. Stick with it. It\\'s too late now. There are no refunds. You\\'re along for the ride. And your smile is going to be radiant. You\\'ve ***got*** this.Omg that could have been written by me. I felt the same, including almost having a panic attack. Now I\\'m on tray 14 and totally fine. Please don\\'t give up <3The first week is the worst, and once you get through that, it honestly feels more of a routine and less of a burden. I also have anxiety issues and sometimes Invisalign actually helps me feel like Im in control and making positive changes (and I can channel anxiety stress into aggressive chewy use which helps keep my progress up).Same. With anxiety, you can feel like you don\\'t have enough control, but with invisalign, it\\'s like, \"ok, *this* is going to get better, at least. I\\'m taking steps to fix my smile and it *will* get there.\"It may feel like that now, but push through! i just started tray 16 and i am actually enjoying the fact im progressing and my mouth looks/feels a lot better!I was the same! On day 2, I remember reading comments in this sub that were like \"the first week is hard, but 2 weeks later you won\\'t even notice your aligners anymore and you\\'ll forget to take them out before meals sometimes\" I said THERE IS NO WAY. And then 2 weeks later, there I was, not noticing my aligners at all. I\\'m on tray 9 out of 21, starting to see progress, and I am so happy and proud of myself for doing this. We\\'re all going to have the teeth of our dreams! And smile with our mouths open! WOOHOO! You\\'ve got this.This is me rn!! Im only on day 5, projected 21 week plan but ortho said to expect closer to a year. The first 3 days were the worst - still have pain and cant chew much but its much better already. Looking forward to hopefully seeing some results around week 10!!I feel you. The first days are awful. I personally was going through a deep depression. However, I decided that a good step to overcome it was to work on myself so I started invisalign. It hurt a lot the first days but it gets better fast and the next trays didn\\'t hurt as much. Some things that have helped are drinking cool water, an electric toothbrush, sensodyne and GUM flossers.I\\'m about 4 weeks in. I had a few panics in the first few days with discomfort and I struggled to get the trays off. It\\'s all good now though and I\\'m seeing some progress even though very small. I can easily floss between some teeth where I struggled before. It gives me hope. ‚The first weeks are exponentially worse than later weeks.  It gets better though always obviously more annoying than not having them but you\\'ll have a straighter teeth in the endI felt the same way at first . Times going to pass anyway might as well have straight teeth at the end. It\\'s so easy now I wish I would have done it sooner. I\\'m on tray 19 now .I\\'m on tray 10/46 and my teeth already look way better than when I started. After the first couple trays you barely notice any discomfort when putting a new one inOof, it wasn\\'t this way for me at all.  My ortho was aggressive as hell.  20+ attachments and 10 trays from crossbite to straight. Every tray hurt.  Friday was change day, and it\\'d be Tuesday before I stopped groaning every time I put them in.\\n\\nI\\'m glad I did it. So glad.  But it was a chore.I am on biweekly changes because I didn\\'t want to pay $500 extra for that v-pro thing, even though it would bump me up. Maybe I will change my mind...Whats the V-Pro thing? 1st tray user here ‚It is a vibrating device you bite down on for a few min each night that supposedly encourages your teeth to move faster.\\n\\nThis sub has really mixed feelings on it. [Link to a thread discussing this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/c9zgwj/is_the_vpro5_worth_it/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)I felt the same way but now I can tell you that I barely feel them! It\\'s gotten soooo much easier, hang in there!The first week is awful. But by week three or four, I became accustomed to it.I\\'ve had invisalign for 8 months now, I feel like this was one of the best decisions that I made. Your smile will be beautiful, keep your head up :)I had immediate buyer\\'s remorse, too! It really does get better. I would say by 2 weeks in, I felt much more comfortable and less regret-filled! I\\'m about 6 months in now and it all just becomes a new habit and doesn\\'t feel like such an inconvenience. Of course, it will be awesome to be done with it all, but I don\\'t find it takes up so much brain space anymore.They\\'re soo annoying the first few weeks lol. Now I can barely feel them in my mouth. I work with consultations and I apologized for a week because I felt I was speaking funny.Totally can relate. I am just three weeks in and while I have gotten very used to it and it doesn\\'t bother me as much, I too freak out when I change a tray and it alters my mouth structure. I\\'m sure I am being super sensitive and no one else can notice it but right now I have this top duck lip thing and I am wondering why the heck I am putting myself through this. I can honestly say that it does get better, but you\\'re going to have to give it time. \\n\\n(Hi Five) We got this!Being in this group has helped me see the \\'final product\\' and I want those beautiful teeth. I know I won\\'t magically be confident but once the Invisalign is done, I know I will feel so much better. Even if it\\'s just smiling at other\\'s when passing them in the park or ordering coffee at starbucsk!I think everyone goes through this. I had a lot of discomfort at first and struggled with eating and cleaning. I felt like it took over my whole life. But quickly it got better and then got even better as time went on. You got this. Yes it will be a struggle at first but it will get better and you will be so happy with your teeth when you finish! It will be worth it! \\x9dï¸\\x8f coming to this subreddit helped me when I had questions or wanted to know if others struggled with the same thing.I had bruxism because of my anxiety and was always bitting my own teeth during the day. I got invisalign not because of my teeth alignment, they are mostly straight, but because of my anxiety. For the first time in 2 years I feel relaxed, I find them conforting. Give them a shot and give yourself a break. This is a good thing you are doing to yourself :)Thats one of the reasons I decided to get them too! Because Im always clenching or grinding my teeth, because of anxiety, my teeth and jaw are always so uncomfortable. I figured it would be a bonus if, in addition to straight teeth, I could also break that habit. Thanks for sharing this, it makes me more optimistic.Everyone feels that way the first week. Pretty much everyone at least considers just throwing the money away and quitting. It\\'ll pass and you\\'ll be glad you stuck with it.It becomes a part of your routine really quickly.  \\nWhen you start to see the results, your confidence will go through the roof and youll remember why you committed to positive self care.The first 2 days suck and I regreted it majorly. After a week it not too bad. Now I\\'m just over 2 weeks in and it\\'s easy, I can take my liners out in about 20 seconds and my new trays were only uncomfortable for about 24 hours.Ha. Thats to the word exactly my situation. Im on day 3 and its feeling a little bit more manageable. Take it day by day OP! It does get betterI just got my invisalign this morning aswell and I\\'m already going crazyIts not even the pressure or pain thats getting to me, but the sheer discomfort of having an alien object in my mouth. Its making my mouth so dry, my upper lip feels like its protruding, I keep lisping, and I know all of this will go away with time and Ill get used to it, but its just alienating and uncomfortable right now.Yeah I can relate, especially with the dry lips, that was the worst part for me. The lisp went away quicklyYea I don\\'t mind the pressure it\\'s just all that you listedI understand. Im on aligner 14 of 18 and I still have days when I feel like throwing the aligners in the trash. Sorry I am not much help but feel like you do and empathize. Hopefully you will be one of the many people who gets used to the aligners.I just got mine put on 3 days ago. I felt the exact same way the first day. Absolute dread. Im by no means feeling œused to it\\x9d yet. But its growing on me. \\nThe first meal - there was no way I could get them out. I was panicking and starving! Then I started eat any my cheeks were getting mangled, and my teeth were killing me. Horrible start. \\nIve since planned my meals better and what Im going to eat. That has helped a lot. \\nI also bought some Colgate Wisps to keep on me in case I eat while away from home. \\nIm still not good at removing the trays, but Im getting there. Slowly learning to live with it. \\n\\nI guess once I see some progress Ill be more motivated. \\nHang in there bud! You got this!It gets so much easier. I got home on day 1 everything felt fine then suddenly I wanted to take them out to eat and I couldnt get them over the attachments without causing pain and I was in an instant panic. But just 2 days later i was popping them out with ease and everything has been great since. One of the best choices I have ever made.I can totally relate I started crying as I walked home from my first appointment but it does get better! I promise!It gets easy fast!!! You will be so happy with the results that it will all be worth it in the end\\x81Youll be glad you made this investment down the line. Its also a low stakes way to learn just how adaptable you really are!Im on DAY 6! I HATED the first day and felt regret while I was in the chair and while I attempted taking it off. I started smiling and taking pics and I already like how I smile! Feels kinda peaceful knowing Im only going to eat within an hour and just finish two big meals a day. Im a little afraid of how Ill feel after I switch trays for the first time but, just seems like Ill just have to prepare myself to do nothing that day so I can just stay in bed and sleep off the pain LOL. This sub was pretty good by leading me into the direction of having a clear mind tbhI havent had any real pain when I switch aligners. The new one may feel tight but its more of a pressure. I read a suggestion to change your aligner before you go to bed and that helps a lot.I expected to have buyers remorse but i dont. Its been a breeze and a slight inconvenience at most. It also helps me keep my overeating in check!\\n\\nLook at it this way, in 15-18 months you will either have the smile you want, or you wont. Try to think about the positives about it (less eating, better oral health, perfect smile,etc.) instead of the negative aspects on it.\\n\\nCongrats on doing something for yourself towards your own self improvement!Totally normal! Not going to lie, depending on your case it may take months for you to notice improvements (took me at least four). I definitely felt the same way you describe, it will pass with time, just don\\'t give up!Dont ! I promise!!! Youll be so happy you did, once you start seeing progress and movement its all worth it! You wont regret it! I understand the remorse thing and I thought omg what did I get myself into when I paid and the day of my life changing self love journey, but you will get thru this !!!!Four weeks in as of yesterday. Youll feel better soon.Its not that bad. Youll see, I had the same panic the first days, but youll get used to it :)Itll will give you something positive to look forward to: every tray change, every subtle change in your look.I was in a similar place when I started but to he honest its already helped my mental health so much to know I was proactively dealing with something that was stupid and causing me so much unnecessary stress.\\n\\nThis is a worthwhile investment. I promise. :)-The first couple of months were rough. My teeth felt hot and sweaty. After that I forgot they were in. Now I feel weird without it.I felt the same way initially, I just wanted to rip these ugly things out of my mouth!! Like everyone else has said though, it will pass. There will be days though where some trays are just so tight and annoying but waaay more manageable than the first time.  It helped on these days for me to do mindless activities the, like cleaning the bathroom, scrubbing my shoes, repotting my plants, anything that keeps both your hands and mind busy.I felt the same! Especially when in pain after the first day, which doesnt last btw!!! \\nIm 4 months in now and Ive gotten so used to them. You obviously want your teeth fixed. Just remember in 15 months youll be done. Time goes by fast.I felt the exact same way once I finally committed. Now I\\'m 8 months in, and I\\'m honestly kind of indifferent about being finished. It\\'s exciting and all, but the discomfort and feelings of inconvenience already fizzled out, and now taking care of them is just another thing I do. Like peeing or taking out my contacts. Also, I smile at myself in the mirror now, which is probably awesome for the mental health thing.You stop thinking about it after like a week. Hang in there :)You did this to get better and to fix your health! This is a major self love act! I got Invisalign 3 weeks ago and not a day goes by without me swearing ( can\\'t snack, can\\'t drink coffee when I want to, rubber band keeps snapping off, discomfort) but in the long run, I am doing this for myself, finally! It does take a lot of discipline and self control but that is a good thing! Just think about the final result. I am on aligner 2 and already notice a small difference in my bite and my bottom teeth. Hang on in there! You\\'re doing the right thing!I literally got my trays on Monday and felt the same! Like what did I commit to... Fast forward to today- I forget theyre even in sometimesI had this same problem at first. I would break down and cry and say I couldnt do this and didnt know what I was getting into but stick with it!!!I was scared too at the beginning. Immediate regret especially since I didnt know I was going to get brackets (which arent invisible). But honestly most people dont notice, even in pictures. Its a little inconvenient but its made me be more conscious of my oral hygiene (flossing 2x/day, before it was like every other week?), and less snacking. And Im already seeing big results and Im like 1/2 way through. The pain is a lot less than braces and even when I lost my retainer, my orthodontist was able to replace it in less than a week.3 weeks and then you\\'ll be happy.I had lingual braces about 12 years ago and  I lasted 3 days. Cost me a fortune but once I had them in I absolutely knew they would be awful for my mental state and probably give me an eating disorder to boot. \\n\\nOver time I started to wish I\\'d stuck with it and bit the Invisalign bullet last year. The fact that you can take the trays out makes such a difference, and that\\'s what sold me on it - but actually you probably won\\'t want to take them out as your mouth feels better with them in! But just knowing you can whip them out makes all the difference. As others have said, just keep on going. There is so much support here, so shout if you need us.The day I got mine I completely panicked too and felt instant regret feeling that I couldnt do this for months\\n\\nNow its been over a year and my treatment is completed in a couple of weeks.  its like time flew by :) \\n\\nYoull get through this!SAME!!!! but I got over it!!!You will get used to it! I felt the same. But eventually I saw the progress my teeth made and now I thank myself everyday I stuck with it! You got this!!! Its worth it my friend.I also felt the same immediately but within about 3-4 days the discomfort went away and it was effortless. I had 48 original trays, and on 12 refinements now, it\\'s been a breeze after the initial \\'oh shit\\' period.I almost cried my first day, just trying to eat with these attachments on my teeth. LOL. You get used to it in no time. You got this!The time is going to pass anyway, might as well be improving your quality of life while it passes.Omg I remember feeling this way! You described it so well. \\n\\nI promise promise promise you will get through this and will be feeling a lot better so soon. Just hang in there a few more days. You got this!!!! The results are so amazing, you WILL find a groove in the routine of it. And it will stop hurting and being such a thought and chore. Just takes a little time.It will be ok, really. I\\'m on tray 13/25 and I am very very used to them. It didn\\'t take long either. You will appreciate the difference it makes over time. I felt angry at first too. I had already gone through braces when I was a kid and didn\\'t want to go through a similar experience with Invisalign. But I\\'m very happy I am doing it. You will too. Hang in there!I felt the same. I\\'m neurotic. I told myself if I\\'m an adult and I hate it I can now choose to stop and waste my money but that was just to get rid of the anxiety. I\\'m a month in and it\\'s fine. Not a big dealI absolutely can relate!! I started Invisalign in September and the week after getting them I went on vacation to Sedona, and could not bring myself to smile properly because I was so embarrassed of what felt like a HUGE PIECE OF PLASTIC EVERYONE CAN SEE. But a couple weeks later I absolutely got used to them, and very soon I started noticing that my teeth actually look better and straighter in photos despite (or maybe thanks to) me wearing Invisalign. \\nNobody around me ever notices it, and I feel very confident weaeing it now that I\\'m halfway through my treatment and can see great results already! \\n\\nYou got this - this is an amazing investment in your health and confidence and you deserve to celebrate!!The first two days are awful. \\n\\nThe first two weeks still kinda suck. \\n\\nBy month two, its super smooth sailing.First 2-3 days are by FAR the worst. Many people feel this way. I bet by the end of the weekend youll be alright.I felt this way when I started too! Once you get used to it it\\'s much better. It\\'s honestly actually helped my mental health bc I\\'m so excited for nice teeth....and I know I HAVE to brush/floss more than I was before - it\\'s no longer \"optional\" depending on how I feel...which is strangely motivating \\x81\\n\\nEveryone on here is super nice and helpful too! So make sure you post questions or pics for encouragement if you want to \\x81The first two weeks were horrendous. If someone had of offered me morphine I would have taken it. I felt stupid for hurting myself so much, naÃ¯ve for thinking itd be fine, and totally regretted it. Then after about two weeks one night I got up to go to the loo, made it back to bed and only then remembered I was wearing them. Things started to get easier. The first two weeks I wanted nothing more than to rip them out of my mouth. Im now on week 12, I still dont find them comfortable, but no more than the feeling of wanting to take my bra off or a tight pair of jeans after a long day. Youll be fine, youve committed to the money now. Just sit it out for a few weeks and itll get easier.I felt the exact same way, but I promise it gets better! The first day I was like wtf did I just do and that feeling slowly subsided!Same here, I am on tray 15/96, only thing keeping continuing is to get the Final results and to get the perfect teethEverybody told me it gets better And it does. I had intense anxiety at the beginning every time I put the liners in my mouth. Is like claustrophobia. I am now eight weeks in and the anxiety has gone away. The discomfort Yep, theyre uncomfortable. And its intimidating to think about the path ahead. But Im in it.\\n\\nI trust it will get better for you and you get to choose. If it doesnt work for you and I dont do itThe past one year with Invisalign went by so fast for me. And now my teeth look amazingggg. I can\\'t claim to know exactly how you\\'re feeling and what else you have on your plate. But if you\\'re like me, getting a nice boost from accomplishing things, you\\'ll feel awesome a year from now.Its very overwhelming at first. Im almost 2 years in and while that is a long damn time, Im soooo used to it now.I felt the exact same way when I started last October, but I promise you these intense feelings will pass, and it absolutely will get better. Now I\\'m 12 trays in and get excited when it\\'s time to switch to a new tray. The pain will subside, you will figure out a routine, and soon, you won\\'t mind them. I do feel your pain at the moment though. It\\'s going to get better sooner than you think. Keep your head up! You got thisi was the same way: i had a mental breakdown as soon as i left the orthodontists office, and figured that i would be depressed and remorseful for the entire 14 month long treatment. fast forward to week two, and i feel the same way i did prior to getting them” i no longer feel pain when putting on my new aligners, and while i can no longer prolong my mealtimes to watch shows, its definitely not nearly as bad as it was the first few daysWhen I got my invisalign attachments last week (on many of my top and bottom teeth) my orthodontist must have sensed I was on the verge of a similar panic attack and patted my shoulder‚\\n\\nThey do suck at first, but just think how awesome your teeth will look in the end. And yes I was worried that they would make me look unattractive, but I decided that it really just doesn\\'t matter what other ppl think-just another way to see who\\'s real and who\\'s fake I guess.Humans are creatures of habit, you will get used to it. Not sure how much you disliked your teeth but I would say its worth it. Come back to this post in a few weeks after the adjustment period.Went through the same thing. Ill DM you, as I dont want to share everything here.One of the best decisions I\\'ve ever made when it comes to investing in me. The smile from ear to ear for the first few weeks after you finish your treatment is worth it on its own!I promise this will pass and youll be so thankful you did this for yourself.I had the same thing happen to me. I also had a jaw expander inserted, which honestly reminds me of an old torture device. Scared the living fuck out of me. \\n\\nI dealt with it and now I look back and Im so proud of myself for finding the strength to continue with it all. Nothing compares to having perfect straight teeth!!!Yeah when I talked to them dentists I felt like I was talking to a salesman leaving out details of the experience and just trying to get your money... Which they were. It\\'s not necessary but you\\'re already kind of committed now, ficially at least.Stick with it. I felt so similar. It all got better for me around week 3.I recently got Invisalign as well and I felt the same way! I hated it it the first couple days. One thing that helped me is just remembering that you are doing it to improve Yourself amd you will be very glad in the endYoure gonna have a great smile when youre done! Think of how thatll help your self esteem and mental health. You can do it!Nov 25 2019. Day 1. Last Tuesday one of my best friends was shocked to discover I was still in my Invisalign phase. Covid lengthened everything. My orthodontist is in another country but it made sense at the time as Im there 50% of the time. She was gobsmacked as shed completely forgotten. Its a way of life for me. Waiting for my first set of refinements. No regrets. I love it. Probably have another six months. Love being a part of that almost secret society. Close friends and associates really do forget. I carry a great sense of achievement as you will too. Hang on in there.Happens to eveybody, you get used to it and eventually will feel like nothingThe 1st and 2nd day it was terrible and I had this weird urge like I needed to eat/swallow them. It gets better!I did the same thing driving home with them for the first time.

I\\'m getting my first trays soon and am assuming I have to eat soup for a few weeks while my skull and brain adjust to this new change/routine. My question is: are there any foods that you\\'ve found are just not worth the trouble during treatment, whether bc they get stuck in your teeth, cause pain, are tough to bite into, or they stain the attachments? I just learned about the inevitability of loose/wobbly teeth the other day and I have not known peace since. How does anyone eat with loose teeth? What does anyone eat with loose teeth? \\n\\nAppreciate any insights; this sub has been super helpful in getting me motivated to finally get Invisalign...so thank you!I havent had to alter what I eat at all, other than not being able snack as easily. I still eat the same things as before and not everyone has a painful first week either, I didnt!Wow congrats on having such a smooth experience! Fingers crossed I have the same fortune...I havent been able to chew chips and steak. Also anything spicy is a no go for me. I have been eating avocados, rice, soup, and eggs. On some days I can eat baas (depending on the level of ripeness). Chips are soooo painfulI hear you!!!How long did this last?Having to probably give up my usual 4 baas/day habit is going to be devastating, hopefully can cut them up and enjoy occasionally. I\\'m planning to eat a lot of soup/eggs/avocado, but fantastic to know that rice might be doable. Is the \"no spicy food\" because of staining? Thanks!Yes, baas used to be my favorite breakfast food. I used to eat a lot of spicy foods like habanero and jalapeÃ±o peppers. I would say staining is not a problem rather, the new burning sensation in my mouth. µ LOLMake sure to avoid putting your trays in after eating turmeric because it will stain them!Yes I\\'ve decided to only make foods containing turmeric/curry/etc at the end of each tray to minimize the training. I can\\'t give up Indian food. Thanks!Tread carefully.   The turmeric stains the attachments, not so much the alignersI\\'m on tray 2 and haven\\'t come across anything that i\\'ve stuggled to eat yet. I\\'d advise avoiding curry unless you can brush. Stained my first trays when i put them back in afterwards.Oh man that must have been annoying. Yes I plan to only have curry towards the end of each tray and def brush afterwards. Thanks!I ate with mine on. Avoid mustard.Did you eat with your trays in?I did!\\n\\nOnly reason you shouldnt is cus cavities, but if you brush your teeth/trays after a meal you\\'ll be fine.\\n\\nSo,\\n\\nCons: Lotsa brushing, potential to stain trays and have high-lighter mouth for a week\\n\\nPros: No fear of breaking off a loose tooth when eating, can literally eat jawbreakers and be fine. Also puts tension on your teeth so you dont have to chew on a glorified chew-toy to settle your teeth, it gets done when you eat. \\n\\nOrthodontist recomended that I do this, and 2 years after my treatment my teeth still look good. I think the experience was less painful for me as well since I put tension on my teeth during every meal, making the treatment faster, so I could afford to sometimes not wear them without having any negative movementsWow that\\'s so wild I\\'ve never heard of anyone being advised to eat with their aligners in! I\\'ll have to ask my ortho. You\\'re right about the fear of breaking off a loose tooth, it\\'s the stuff of nightmares. Thanks and congrats on your successful treatment!Thanks! I try to spread the knowledge a bit as my ortho basically told me to do this like a mad scientist would, but it genuinely worked, and i didnt break off any teeth.\\n\\nThumbs up in my books!Im getting Invisalign and on my appointment to see my ClinCheck my ortho also told me I could eat things like baas and yoghurts etc with aligners in.Interesting....but wouldn\\'t you have to wash the trays/brush your teeth afterwards anyway?She said as long as I rinsed my mouth at the very least  that would be okay. But Im supposed to be changing every 7 days (not sure if that means wear on trays isnt as important) and she said in the long run itll be more important that I wear them consistently to get the desired results faster (22h + wear time). As long as I brush after main meals itll be fine.I\\'ve been able to eat most foods, but anything tough and chewy is irritating for me. I would just avoid anything that is too firm for me to chew. I\\'m also Asian, and most of our food dishes involve spices, so I have to brush really well after eating.Yes I\\'m also getting bite ramps and was told I would have trouble biting into firm things like apples. I suppose my idea of what\\'s \"chewy\" might change as I go along. I\\'m also Asian and concerned about all the spices, and if I\\'ll be able to bite down on rice. We shall see. Thank you and good luck with your treatment!Im almost moving onto tray 3, zero pain & zero food obstacles, good luck!Thank you, good luck to you as well! Congrats on having a painless experience thus far, hope it continues for you (and same for me.....).I think 98% of people have an event less experience. Its the 2% that do that flood Reddit with their nightmares. Trust me, dont listen to them, youre going to be fine.Here here, youll be fine & think about the end result for all of us :)Chips hurt. I dont really eat meat or candy to begin with so cant comment on that. I drink alcohol with mine in.I had a feeling chips would be difficult to bite down on (if my bite gets weird), didn\\'t realize it would actually hurt. I\\'ve just been eating all the chips in the house as a last hurrah, hopefully I\\'ll be sick of them by time I start. Thanks and good luck with your treatment!Hahah its more of a soreness but Id just rather not deal.Doritos and other corn chips have been a pain to get out of my teeth since getting InvisalignI can imagine; they\\'re a pain for me even without Invisalign. Thanks and good luck with your treatment![deleted]Makes perfect sense. Thanks and good luck with your treatment!I eat as normal. I dont eat anything chewy like sweets that I feel could potentially stay stuck in a tooth after a quick brush before popping the trays back in. You dont have the normal saliva cleaning your teeth all day so not a good idea to have any particles trapped.It really depends on where in your trays you are is what I have found. First few days of a new tray- chips hurt and biting into things hurt like a sandwich or something like that, but after like 4-5 days of a new tray I can eat whatever. Same thing goes for pain- my teeth only really hurt the first few days of a new tray. I have not heard of the loose teeth thing or chipping off a tooth ¬I love everything and can eat everything\\n\\nBut chips get stuck in my spaces now I just got Invisalign a few days ago and my teeth only hurt the first 3 days. Mostly taking them out and putting them back in, but I never had to change my diet. I did get my teeth shaved and they did feel very sensitive when I ate though.For me, the first few days were a little sore. Use Advil or Tylenol. I made the mistake at eating something too hard such as a baguette from Panera and ripping it hurt my front teeth :( so soft things that dont put pressure on the teeth that hurt. After that, I havent had many issues. Im on my 2nd set- and this time around I didnt even need to take anything or change my diet at all. Wishing you luck and good results Ž‰I had to stay away from caramels in the beginning, it was just too damn complicated to get cleaned off the attachments and my teeth after -it wasn\\'t worth it.\\n\\nI had a ton of movement happening with my lower front teeth,so there was a period where I couldn\\'t bite/tear anything, nearly choked on spaghetti noodles before I determined I had to cut it into bite size first, and I couldn\\'t eat pizza for a while.\\n\\nSalad was tricky for a bit while my bite adjusted into place...\\n\\nIt\\'s been a journey of trial and error for sure.\\n\\nI\\'m desperate for it to be over.Nothing\\'s changed, but I only eat one meal a day and I don\\'t snack, so it\\'s easy just to have the trays out for an hour to eat and clean everything.Popcorn and nuts. It doesnt matter how much I floss I still have junk stuck in my new spaces. So annoying.Wotsits! I love them but honestly they are a pain, they stick to my teeth and make cleaning afterwards a nightmare!Popcorn. I love it and go to the cinema often. But getting a kernel stuck between my tooth is not worth the hassleGummy candy.  \\n\\nI stopped eating them completely because its harder to clean. \\n\\nApples, because I cant bite into them and Im too lazy to cut them to pieces. \\n\\nSometimes when I am feeling lazy and dont want to spend so much time cleaning and flossing, I avoid meat.eating the same. granted for first 2 days i tried to eat things that were easy to chew like noodles or soft rice and that i didnt have to use my front teeth for but besides that, on day 4 now and i eat normally, just chew slightly slower on one side cus its a lil sensitive but im on day 4 of my first tray so its expected.I have eaten whatever.

Ask me anythingHi, thanks for doing this! Ive been doing Invisalign since June last year but Ive only actually seen my ortho 3 times in that period. He gave me all of my trays up front and instructions on what to do, however one tooth stopped tracking in Jan so when I saw him then he had to take new moulds and order a new set. I picked up the new 44 trays yesterday but he just left them for me at reception even though he was in. I really like him, he responds to emails etc but should he really be seeing me more often or am I just being a bit needy!!!?!! I was hoping to be completely done by the end of this summer but now these trays alone will take me through to next April and I dont want another issue to set me back even more. Thanks in advanceIve literally never met my ortho and Im sort of convinced they arent even real. Just a dentist masquerading as the face of an ortho. Probably why my treatment has been 40 initial trays and 56 refinement trays when all I want is one tooth straitened out and to be done with it. 56 trays and that tooth is more crooked then when I started.I dont know if he œshould\\x9d be seeing you more often.\\n\\nDifferent dentists/orthos run things in different ways and thats their personal choice.\\n\\nHowever if you feel hes not giving you good œcustomer service\\x9d , then maybe mention it politely to the staff at the practice.\\n\\nI personally always want to keep my patients happy and avoid an issue. \\n\\nSome patients want more personal contact than others.I got mine in July and ive only seen mine 3 times too.

But yeah you're probably fine to skip seeing the ortho if your trays are fitting. You wear them for the 22 hours etcat least yours took new molds, new scan and had trays made according to your updated condition....\\n\\nI lost track of one tooth as well at 25/39, i asked if he could just re scan and make the new sets from there but he said to wear the original to the end and just go back to him when I am around the last sets for a re scan at that point and make sets if needed.... now i just left that country and i might end up with just one tooth bad tracked and the rest fine, which sucks...\\n\\nOn top of that, I had to start modifying my aligners myself in order to fit them properly, since the tooth that didn't track is inclined, the aligner will just press on the tooth down if not corrected... I had to use a hole punch, not the clear aligners one since I did not want to pay for that tool, but a Hole punching device I have for belts and such things... Hole punch the inside of that aligner in the position of the lagging tooth, now it fits almost perfectly.... \\n\\nwearing my aligners for 18 days instead of 14 to try prevent another tooth lagging behind.I only ever see my ortho at the end of every set of trays (had 33 inital trays, just finished 14 refinememts with elastics and need another 12 with IPR) or if I need to go in to replace attachments/metal buttons for my elastics. What I really like though is they gave me this 'scanning box' where I can place my phone and take a picture of my teeth at the end of each week and the ortho confirms if I can switch onto the next tray or keep the current one on for a few more days if a certain tooth isn't tracking properly.that is unknown technology for me, sounds very nice and it is good to hear that your dentist is on your treatment, following up via phone app whatnot.I see my ortho every 6 or 7 weeks. They didnt give me all of my trays up front because they wanted to ensure that all of my teeth were tracking (one actually stopped tracking so he needed to develop a plan for that for my next round of refinements)I see mine monthly and he gives me two new aligners and checks to see that attachments are still in place . I wish it was less often.kind of a hassleyou could tell him that you are going to be very busy, to set your appointments more far apart... but trust me, it is a hassle now but it would be more of a hassle if the dentist didn't care and you end up doing a refinement after refinement.Wow, be happy, mine just sent me off with all my trays and I don't have an appointment for approximately 3 months, I pray everything works and hopefully I would know if it's not working, been reading all Invisalign post for information!I started Invisalign in June and Ive probably seen my ortho 8 times. I started my refinements two months ago and she only gives me 4 trays at a time. And its not like she gets more money by doing this. Ive already paid everything out right. I definitely feel more comfortable knowing she is monitoring my progress.Hi. I was told by my dentist to use chewies 20 minutes per day. In another post in this sub the use of chewies seems to be controversial. What are your thoughts or convictions on the subject?Using chewies always seems to improve the predictability of my Invisalign cases. I would use them!Piggybacking on this ” I was told to use chewies to seat my aligners after having them off, but should I be actively using them more through the day too? (Like GP mentioned 20min there) thanks!If you use them throughout the day too, then you will get a more predictable resultCool, good to know thanks! ‘\\x8dI grind/clench my teeth a lot naturally and stopped using chewies awhile ago. My ortho says everything is tracking great. Is it possible the grinding is acting similarly to using chewies?Yes probablyThanks for the reply :) Cheers[deleted]Tricky question. Ask your own dentisti bite my bath towel few times and that's it.A lot of people of the belief that traditional braces are superior to Invisalign. As a [severe case](https://old.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/so5c80/2848_and_for_the_first_time_in_my_life_my_lateral/) of crowding with a cross bite i was doubtful myself that Invisalign would work for me, especially as i am in my mid 30s but im so happy with my progress. \\n\\nDo you think Invisalign will eventually overtake traditional metal braces as the most commonly used orthodontic treatment, even for severe cases like mine? And right now do you think there is really any reason to go with traditional braces over Invisalign aside from compliance issues?Traditional braces will always have their place for 2 reasons.\\n1) compliance: most teenagers are not compliant enough for removable appliances and they cant take off fixed braces themselves.\\n2) forces: fixed braces pull whereas aligners push.\\nSome cases will benefit more from one movement than the other, ie they are good at doing different things.How to know if youre tracking correctly? Ive just started my second tray and I dont want any set back for the trays to come so what are the signs to look for to know if everything is tracking correctly?If youve worn the tray for the prescribed time (7-14 days) and the teeth are still not fully inserted into them- ie there is an œair gap\\x9d of 2mm or more between the tip of the tooth and the aligner. \\n\\nAlso If the attachments are not siting roughly in the attachment poroof the trayOk thanks!!Hi! Can your teeth œstretch\\x9d the aligners? I have 6 sets of passive aligners for my top arch and whenever I change to the next one my teeth feel a little tight. Shouldnt they feel the same as the previous passive aligner, and just look fresher?Yes the aligners will stretch and warp if worn for a long period.\\nThe upper teeth may be trying to relapse slightly as well.Interesting! Thank you. I guess thats why they arent used as retainersI have this too. 19 on bottom arch, but only 11 on top, so I have 8 top arch passive aligners, and they leats feel snugger and tighter when changed. I have had the top attachments removed, but the passive  aligners still have all the attachment dimples inhave you got the same?No my attachments are still on but theres only a couple of them. It does feel strange how tight they are when changed but at least they arent mega painfulI finished treatment and had attachments removed and retainers made a few days ago. The retainers are causing me a lot of pain (more than I ever had with my Invisalign trays!) and I know I can file them but I feel like they need to be cut down significantly. Im planning to go into the ortho next week to see what they say, but heres my question: if Im only wearing my retainers about 12 hours a day, will my teeth shift back quickly? How truly necessary is it for an adult to wear retainers post treatment for 22 hrs a day for the first few months? Do some people only wear at night right after and keep their teeth from moving back? Thanks!It depends on the movements your teeth went through. 12 hours a day wear should keep them in place though if youre putting them in nightly. The teeth may shift a little during the day, but the retainer will push them back at nightThanks! Im hoping if they can trim and file the parts that are causing pain (its mainly when I talk w them in and Im a teacher so I talk a lot ‚) Ill then be able to wear them closer to 20 hrs a day. Just dont want to throw away the time, money, and effort I put into the treatment!Absolutely I understand. Have you tried applying a bit of wax (orthowax) to the edge of the retainer?If your teeth are smaller than average, is it harder to close gaps with invisalign/braces?If your teeth are smaller than average and you have gaps, then the issue is that when you close some gaps, other gaps may open up.\\n\\nOften this means that it is necessary to use restorative methods (composite build ups/veneers) to close the spaces.\\n\\nIts easier in dentistry to make small teeth bigger than big teeth smaller!Ã\\x8d went to two different invisalign providers, the first one gave me a timeline of 6 months and second of 12-15months, I understand different dentists give different timelines but I feel like this is a big difference between the two. \\nWhat's your opinion?Go with the one who gives you the longer estimate, youll be less disappointed. I imagine the 6 month huy hasnt considered your case closely enough.Its been 7 months since I finished my 2 year Invisalign treatment to close my big gaps. I know youre supposed to wear a retainer forever, but I know some people only wear theirs at night or a few nights a week after a year or so. \\n\\nI noticed about an hour after I take my retainer out my gap between my two front teeth starts to open up. There was an incident last week where I was sick and forgot to put my retainer in for two days. When I did put them back in I was surprised at how snug they were. It was almost like putting in a new tray for the first time during treatment. The discomfort only lasted a minute however and everything is good now. \\n\\nIs it always going to be like that? Are teeth really constantly trying to revert back to their old positions.\\n\\nI remember the first Ortho I went to recommended metal braces for me and suggested I needed a surgery to cut the frenulum halfway through the treatment. \\n\\nThe second Ortho I went to and did Invisalign through said the surgery wasnt necessary, but now Im wondering if thats why that gap opens up so quickly between the two front teeth.I personally like to place a fixed wire retainer after Ive closed a big gap between teeth, as I find this situation susceptible to relapseWhat's your recommendation if you can't wear a wire? Every doctor I've consulted said I couldn't have a wire due to my anatomy. I'm afraid my teeth will always relapse without itIf you cant wear a wire (sounds like youre gonna snitch on the mob!) then get viveras and wear them for at least 12 hours/day for a yearI'm not the dentist but I know from others that if the gap is constantly trying to reopen you most likely need a frenectomy to see if it will stop. If not, you may need a bonded retainer in addition to plastic retainers to keep it closed.\\n\\nI would go back to the orthodontist and communicate this to them and ask for a referral for a frenectomy.[deleted]Maybe. Perhaps you should go back to your dentist and check.Should my provider have reattached attachments after around 6 fell off on my first night? 1 fell off while getting my first aligner fitted (so immediately after they were applied)\\n\\nHe said it was no big deal as some are more important than others and they didn't need to be redone, just to make sure to use a chewy for half an hour daily, but it's basically all of my top teeth, I've gone for weeks feeling like my aligners are essentially sliding off.I personally tell my patients not to worry if one or 2 fall of, unless its on a crucial tooth which requires a lot of movement. 6 however sounds like quite a lot.\\n\\nWhen I see my patients at review Ill rebond the attachments, however I dont ask them to come in as an emergency for lost attachments.\\n\\nIf youre in additional aligners/refinements, then chances are the attachments are less crucial.I am now waiting my first clincheck, but just after seeing me for the very first time a few months ago (I removed 4 wisdom teeth on the meantime) my ortho told me the treatment will be about one year long (to be confirmed) with 14 days changes.\\nHe was talking like 14 days its the standard, but I now believe that the majority of the Reddit Invisaligners change trays every 7 days.\\nDo you think it is a general personal preference of my ortho (very experienced one) or something specifically related to my case?\\nIs there any advantages for longer intervals? \\nThank you in advance!Its partly personal preference, but other factors affect the rate of tray turnover: age of patient, difficulty of movements, gum health. \\n\\nId follow your orthos advice. Better to do the process more slowly but predictably.Thank you! I will definitely follow his advice in any case.\\nIt was just a curiosity, since I thought having twice the amount of trays, but with half the frequency should technically be the same, but a little bit more hygienic/practical (lesser staining..) and easier (less œfirst day\\x9d pain)If it helps any, I wear mine for 14 days and don't have staining. Soak your trays when they are out of your mouth for meals/teeth brushing (e.g., jar with lid if at work) *I never let mine dry, rinse your mouth/remove stained-saliva if eating stain-causing foods and drinks, brush your trays+teeth, floss. Can use a sonic cleaner. I haven't used mine very often as I don't notice a difference (no staining happening), so I just use it for hygiene intentions instead since I already bought it.Can you explain how each of these factors affects the prescribed time?The older you are, the slower teeth move, the more difficult the movement, the slower to achieve, if theres a worry about historic perio (gum) health it can be wise to ask for slower movements.\\n\\nTheres a few other factors tooHi there. Im now at the end and at the wire retainer thing behind the teeth. What would you say is the best way to clean them and the teeth as flossing isnt an option now. Thank you!\\n\\nPs, cant recommend Invisalign highly enough!Either tepees or similar interdental brushes or superfloss.Thank you!My ortho said hed suggest for me a combo of the fixed wire retainer + Vivera. \\n\\nIs it easy to remove the wire bonded retainer at any point, and if yes, would I be able to use the same Vivera trays or would I have to buy new plastic retainers too? I hear theyre a bit pricey and people change them yearly because of that.Its easy enough for the dentist to remove the fixed wires yes. The vivera would still fit if you took the wires off afterWhat about a water flosser?Im not a big fan, but theyre better than nothingConsidering getting a Waterpik for that very reason!The combo waterpik + toothbrush is amazingMy orthodontist said that when I completely finish my treatment, that I will only need to wear the retainer at bedtime. Not during the day. Ive read a lot of orthodontist websites, and on this Reddit, that you must wear them all day and at night after Invisilign treatment.\\nWill wearing my retainer only at night be ok? Theres too much conflicting info on the internet!It depends on your case. Trust your orthodontistThank you for answering, and  I do trust her, But Im curious as to why the info varies so muchwould you tell a patient to only wear them at bed time?Because every case is different. \\n\\nIf one of my patients has fixed wire retainers and didnt have significant expansion of the back teeth, then yes I might say night time only is okThank you so much for your time on this thread! Answering a lot of questions.My opinion is to trust your body - your teeth will tell you if you need to wear the retainers more often if they are sore, or the retainers are painful or very tight. Not sure if you've ever gone a long period during a day without wearing a tray and felt any of this - but if it feels like that then you need to wear them more.\\n\\nMost orthodontists tell their patients the same thing with wearing retainers but we're all different and our teeth move at different rates.Hi, please answer this bc Im so curious. Im on tray 1, change weekly. I tried on tray 6 to see if they fit. They do fit my teeth easily. Does it mean mu teeth dont move at all during 6 weeks?Thats not a typical Invisalign situation, but the plastic in the trays is quite flexible and your dentist may have only prescribed small movements for the first 6 trays. \\n\\nHow many trays total in your course of treatment?There are 30 trays. I got traditional braces but wasnt happy with the result so he put me on Invisalign to tip the teeth out, making my jaw wider.I notice a film on the inside of my alligners, even if I brush them twice a day. Whats happening here and how do I clean them? I think my aligners are stinky in the morning when I wake up. What can I soak it in to get œfresh\\x9d feeling aligners. I brush my teeth abt 5 times a day and brush my aligners twice a day; I also need to go in with a q tip to clean the aligners.Not OP but I use ultrasonic cleaner where I immerse aligners (or other objects to clean) in water and ultrasound cleans them like no other means (sorry for my English)Yes! So much easier and sparkling clean.Oh ok, I have one of those. U use just wanter?YesSame here, I use the Dental Pod ultrasonic cleaning systemRetainer briteWhen you take your aligners out, put them in water. What makes them get gross is letting them dry out when they come off. Some people add a little dish soap when they soak them but I found I cant get the taste of soap out. I just put them in water and brush them every time before I put them back in if I can. Theres also a foam cleaner you can use that cleans them as you are wearing them if you want to look into that. But its kind of expensiveThanksMix water and hydrogen peroxide together in a cup. When I take out my trays in the morning when I wake up and at night while eating dinner, I put them in the cup to soak for awhile.  Rinse them off or brush them before putting them back in. It keeps them clean.ThanksI am not able to visit my dentist one month and a half after my last tray to remove attachments and get a permanent retainer - is it alright I just wear the last tray for that time?Yes that will hold the teeth in position. I often have my patients wear the last try to retain things for up to a month.Whats the average total cost for a patient?In the UK I think that the average costs are between Â2K and Â4K, plus extra potential costs for retention and cosmetic amendments at finishThank you for your answer!I'm a few trays away from finishing my treatment but have suddenly noticed a sharp shooting pain that lasts a couple seconds when I drink water on one of my teeth/gum around it. (Just sometimes, not all the time) Since I'm seeing my dentist in a couple weeks anyway should I just leave it or should I ring and ask to be seen? Worried it could be the start of a receding gum or root damage. It's the tooth next to one of my teeth that's done a fair amount of movement, (elastics, it was a tooth that was pushed behind and is now being bought forward) the gum only looks slightly damaged.It could be recession, or possibly the tooth is a little sensitive due to the orthodontic movement. I would suggest using sensodyne (or a similar toothpaste) and just mention it to your dentist at the next routine checkHi! Does each aligner on the journey move my teeth at the same pace or are there some aligners that will have more impact than others ? \\n\\nIm basically wondering if the teeth shifting is constant over time or if I can expect bigger transformation a some pointThe latter is usually true. Also sometimes the tooth position will seem to get worse before it gets better. It depends on how your dentist has programmed your clinicheck.Thanks !How much of the payment the client makes stays with you and how much goes to Invisalign?The lab bill we pay to Invisalign varies depending on how many cases we do per year. If I do enough cases then my discount may go up to 50%.\\n    Lot of dentists will charge double or triple the Invisalign lab fee, but bear in mind that the overheads in running a dental practice are highIve had braces before (8-10y ago) and probably my roots have shortened due to braces treatment; now when doing Invisalign, my doctor refuses to get my changes down from 3 weeks to 2 weeks as they are afraid for root resorption. What are the chances for this and would fortnightly changes be possible as Invisalign should not be that harsh as traditional braces?Maybe. The risk is certainly lower with Invisalign, but it seems reasonable for your doctor to take extra precautions do you not think?I do agree, at the same time I have never heard of three weeks changes. Thank you for your input and for answering everyones questions!I was on three week changes and only moved to two weeks when I could show my teeth had adjusted to each new aligner by the seventh day. I have a pretty severe case, not sure if that influences it.thank you for sharing!Hi, super interesting post, thanks Op!\\n\\nSo my question is for an overbite, does Invisalign bring your top teeth back or move the bottom ones forward? Or both? Does moving your bottom teeth forward involve your jaw moving in some way?\\n\\nThanks!No problem!\\n\\nInvisalign can do a bit of both, but I would be aiming to mostly retract the upper top teeth to correct an over jet (I assume thats what you mean).\\n\\nIn a adult were not really making the jaw itself grow or move especiallyCan Invisalign be used to correct the bite (specifically for minimal overbite), or would conventional metal braces be preferable?It depends on the individual case, but yes Invisalign can do this. Sometimes it can be more easily achieved with fixed braces however.Thanks! Hoping to avoid train tracks round 2, but lets see thenDefinitely not a professional, but I have Invisalign to fix a mild overbite and a few other minor issues and it is working so well and so quickly!Thank you! Thats good to know. Mine is pretty mild, so I have hope nowYes!! If your ortho said that its possible, then it probably is. My brother just finished his treatment and his overbite was worse than mine (not bad, but worse) and his teeth/bite are totally perfect nowIll get some consults lined up soon to get a few opinions from orthos. A little annoyed my previous ortho only focused on getting my teeth perfect and not the bite. But anyway, its still better than what I started out withYeah thats very annoying. Do you mean that you had a consult and they only focused on straightening your teeth, or you already had treatment and they only focused on the teeth not the bite,That I had two years of braces and they mainly just focused on straightening the teeth. My dentist kept going on about how my overbite made me look more youthful, when I just wanted to look normal and am not into having an overbite just to œbe youthful\\x9d. It was a little odd\\n\\nEdit: and subsequent dentists have told me my bite is off still and needs correcting.Holy, thats so frustrating especially given that an overbite isnt only aesthetic, it can also be a very real health problem. Well I hope that youre able to fix this issue with Invisalign! I have faith :)Thanks! Me too. It was all the cleaning that I couldnt stand with conventional braces all over again. Im such a snackerUnfortunately Invisalign is definitely also tough for snackers too, and theres lots of cleaning involved. Im not a snacker so its been really easy for me to wear my trays 20+ hours, but cleaning the trays is something that I loathe hahaIm only halfway through my treatment (overbite, overjet and severe crowding) and my bite has shifted dramatically. My jaw is noticeably further forward.Thanks, thats good to know. I had conventional metal braces and it did shift my jaw forwards, but my ortho seemed a bit obsessed with keeping my œchildlike\\x9d (her words) overbite to an extent and seemed worried Id hate the result if she moved my jaw much further forwards. Subsequent dentists have commented that my lower jaw still needs to come forwards a bit, so Im wondering about getting braces again for thisCan invisalign be used in conjunction with a hyrax expander post-SARPE?Im sorry Im not familiar with a Hyrax expander, or the acronym SARPE?Is the adjustment per tray linear? It feels like my earlier ones were big adjustments and my later ones are hardly changing my teeth but it could be just perceptionSome trays are doing more movements than others. It is entirely dependent on how the dentist has programmed your clinicheck> SARPE\\n\\nSurgically Assisted Rapid Palatal Expansion.Ok thanks!My dentist sent me to Endodontist midway though Invisalign treatment and now they are recommending removing one tooth (upper last one from the left #15). How fucked am I? I am 2 weeks from being done but need to get permanent retainers made. Do I wait with removal, remove and get fitted or remove, get a prosthetic tooth and get fitted?This question is a bit beyond the scope of what I can answer here. Best to talk to your own dentist.I'm considering Invisalign treatment but I may be moving to another country by the end of the year. Is it possible to continue my treatment in another country with another Invisalign specialist or should I wait to move to start my treatment?Theoretically possible, but I would advise it. Wait until youre settled in your new country.Thank you for the adviceInvisalign and short roots? Bad idea or depends on the situation?Generally not the best idea, but it depends on how short and how much movementWas told I have level one movement but my roots are short but not that short, thanks!I have 100% overbite and my dentist said she can fix it without attachments. Im on tray 2 of 13 but dont see how that can happen with just trays. Is that possible? My before and after simulation is on my post history.I personally think you need attachments. Is it actually Invisalign youre having, or is it another system like smile direct club?Its a Canadian brand called SureCure. My dentist sees me every month and gives me 3 trays at a time. I have to wear each tray for 2 weeks.Fair enough. I still think you need attachmentsIs a pregt woman more at risk for tooth loss while doing Invisalign?If theres the slightest chance of tooth loss being caused by Invisalign treatment, a responsible dentist would either\\nA) not provide it \\nB) heavily consent you for that possibilitywhat if a woman doing invisalign treatment while not losing any teeth becomes pregt?If youve got a fairly healthy mouth, becoming pregt should have little effect on the Invisalign treatment. In fact it might actually make it more successful as hormonal changes can make the bone softer so the teeth move more easily.Thank you!!!Is this applicable also for breastfeeding women?Shouldnt matter at all, but juggling Invisalign and a young baby will be hard workThanks for your reply, I d say impossible :DIs this your first child? Theres a saying between women that youll always lose a tooth with every chid. For some reason theres a high correlation that a lot of women either need to have a root canal / tooth pulled / or their wisdom teeth come in. Ive needed to have a root canal every time I got pregt. For some reason the root gets inflamed and the pain is unbearable.2 questions: \\n\\n1.Do you have to wait after eating for ur enamel? My dentist told me I can brush right away.\\n\\n2. When Im done with my treatment I heard you either get retainers or a metal wire on ur teeth forever, which is better? I have gaps that Im closing up so which one would keep them closed better?If youre drinking something acidic, then I would not brush straight awayOk and my other question is when Im done with my treatment I heard you either get retainers or a metal wire on ur teeth forever, which is better? I have gaps that Im closing up so which one would keep them closed better?Everyone should get retainers. The metal wire isnt as important for everyone, but in a spacing case, I would suggest itOk thanksMy overcorrecting retainer pushed my inner teeth together a bit ” I now have a fixed wire and permanent retainer. Can I do anything to reverse this? Like going back to my older Invisalign trays? Or would I need to get refinements againYoull need to get refinements again \\nOr have the fixed wire removed and see if the teeth relapse themselves slightlyCould you please explain the purpose of elastics and how they work? I'm due to get mine fitted soon with the attachments, and struggling to understand how they will make a difference if they just seem to connect the top and bottom trays together. Thanks for doing this!Elastics apply pulling forces while aligners provide pushing forces.\\n\\nI think the type of elastics youre describing are providing an extra force to either pull back the upper or lower front teeth.Gotcha, that makes perfect sense! I've got an overbite so they probably need to be pulled back just like you said. Thank you!Is Vivera and Fixed Invisalign Retainers required after finishing the refinement phase?\\n\\nWhich one is more important can I skip one?\\n\\nCost of retainers (Vivera/Metal) is 550 USD / 500 EUR / 420 GBPViveras are an optional , superior, upgrade to the standard plastic œEssix retainer\\x9d. I like them, but theyre not necessarily essential.\\n\\nBonded wire retainers are very helpful if your tooth movements are at high risk of relapse (spacing, rotations, severe crowding)Thanks Doc for your words.\\n\\nI think i will just pay for the whole package and get the best that system can offer.what's the difference of going to you or an ortho?The main reason patients choose to have treatment with me rather than going to an ortho, is cos Ive been looking after their/their kids general dentistry for years so they know and trust me already rather than going to see a new person.  \\n\\nThe other reason is that because Im experienced in restorative work and orthos dont do any, it can be easier to have the same person straighten the teeth and then do the cosmetic work to finish it off.\\n\\nI dont take on all cases however. If its too complex, then I send on to my local orthodontistthanks for the answer and it was what I was actually thinking....\\n\\nwent to my dentist who didn't like the look of the amount of IPR the sim recommended, so they passed me onto an ortho..\\n\\nI have to hop between both now though as I has crown and restoration work to get done..An attachment fell off and my dentist said I didn't need it and that they overplan the attachments. Said it won't make any difference. Is this trueWill it correct a bite and/or help TMJ? Im very confident Invisalign is the reason I developed TMJ 10 years ago and my current dentist is offering it as the solution to my messed up biteIf youve got TMJ issues, you might need splint therapy before starting on Invisalign[deleted]The honest answer is: often were not sure, so you might either over estimate the length to manage your patients expectations, or you may underestimate to try and tell them what they want to hear.\\n\\nTheres a lot of variables which can slow the process downMy orthodontist did the same thing, but said the offset was to account for a certain number of refinement trays. Sure enough, when my initial 24 were up I had a few spots that needed addressing and I was given an addition 12 trays which is putting me at my original 9 month estimate. Now Im just hoping my next 6 trays finish the job and I dont need another round.I struggle with compliance.

You have the benefit of the doubt because you dont know me and this is, well, internet, but I am not an idiot who considers people on Reddit as doctors and will take their comments with me when I visit an ortho. I simply wanted to have a discussion about it with people who have had a similar experience, as I dont know anyone whos had Invisalign. I see this as a safe space where people can share their experience and others might relate. Thats all. Seems like too many people have a problem with that.I got mine because even though my teeth werent that messed up I didnt want to regret it forever. And honestly it depends on your lifestyle. It just takes some responsibility because you have to brush your teeth every time after you eat. And the time is different for everyone, mine is 18 monthsThanks, yeah I also agree its better to fix the issues while they are relatively small.Its def a commitment. I took wearing them and cleaning very seriously. My results were great.You could definitely do it. You would probably be eligible for Invisalign Express/Lite which takes under a year.Thanks! I hope that will be the caseI did it for aesthetic purposes only! Had braces then got a permanent retainer on the bottom. After losing multiple top retainer trays the lateral tooth same as you shifted back and I wanted to bring it forward. Currently doing top arch only and Im on my last tray 10 trays. I go next week to see if I need refinements!Great, thanks for sharing! I hope your visit goes well and that you wont need any refinements :)Thank you! Id say go for it! They will look amazing!My teeth look like yours, I have 13 trays so like 3 months. Im on tray two but I think its worth itNoice! I hope you wont be needing any refinements after 3 months :)These posts are useless. I dont know your bite and how much room you have to move your teeth. If you want a real answer see a dentist. Asking here wont give you anything useful.Wow I didnt know that a dentist can give me a real answer, I thought everyone gets their diagnosis on Reddit :( \\n\\nIm just looking for peoples general opinion based on their personal experience, maybe someone has had similar alignment concerns as I do. Thats all :)I totally get what youre looking for, but its the same as asking Reddit what they think is wrong with a car engine based on a picture with the hood open.\\n\\nDentists do X-rays and alignment checks. Its not just if your teeth look straight. My teeth were perfectly straight but I have alignment issues and its going to take over a year. Based on photos you would think no need for anything.\\n\\nIts a medical procedure as much as anything else so I recommend you go to the experts. Was just trying to help you out here.Of course I will visit the experts and follow their approach, and will not question it because someone on Reddit might have suggested otherwise... I dont know anyone who has had Invisalign so this is my attempt to get some opinion from people who have been thru it (or are going thru rn). I value opinion that comes from personal experience.\\nI hope your treatment goes well and that youll be happy with the end results!Also go to an orthodontist not a dentist \\n\\nBtw I would do it! I don\\'t think it would take more than a year. I had teeth pulled out, but after filling the gaps my smile looked similar to yours and my treatment is only 18 months. About 8 of those have been filling the gaps from the extracted teeth.Basically you want to know if your teeth are bad looking enough.  Once again, don\\'t go to reddit.  I know enough people with TMJ from invisalign and other things where I would say talk o a dentist over strangers.[deleted]Of course not :D I was being sarcasticWould probably qualify for Invisalign lite. My before was probably similar (except for upper arch looks way better than mine before!) and its taking me about 9-10 months including refinements. Youd probably need some IPR done for your bottom arch too.Good to know, thanks for sharing your experience :)I honestly think your teeth are really nice the way they are, you have a lovely smile Š having to wear retainers after braces is not enjoyable in my opinion.Thank you :) What was the biggest issue for you in wearing retainers?Just another thing to have to do in the morning, taking them out covered in drool and washing them straight away to try to prevent them from smelling etc.  Having to wear them every night for the rest of your life when you\\'d really rather not  had I had teeth like yours I wouldn\\'t be bothered with all that I 100% agree. Your teeth look great as is IMO. Invisalign is an expensive pain in the ass that I would not put myself through if I had nice looking teeth already and didnt have bite issues. But it depends on how insecure you are about them.A permanent retainer can help with these issues. I have one and it\\'s very comfortable. Don\\'t have to deal with the hassle of putting my retainer on or cleaning it.If it\\'s not a bite issue, then could be maybe 6 months or less? The ortho I see does free consults, so it should not cost you anything to ask them and get an estimate on how long it would be to fix it :)Thank you, I will for sure visit an ortho, now Im just curious about what others think :)YesI don\\'t think this is a Lite case.\\n\\nCrowded teeth as your bottom ones can take ages to move in case you\\'re not getting a tooth extracted to make the space for them (which you\\'re probably not I assume) - basically all the teeth needs to be pushed back and only after that the straithening can start.\\n\\nI had a similar situation (with a bit of crowding on top as well but it doesn\\'t really matter), got 61 pairs and literally started seeing movement after like 55th tray which was around one year in, which I found extremely annoying.\\nAnd you can see number of refinements next to my name, that speaks for itself so not gonna comment on that...\\n\\nDon\\'t want to discourage you, but it\\'s better to be prepared for the worst to not be frustrated too much, which I definitely was, and still am cause I\\'m still not finished after almost 3 years ƒ\\n\\nMaybe you\\'ll be more lucky, who knows, I\\'m not an ortho, right? ‰Even different ortho will give you a different answer, its up to their plan. Just consult them.Of course I will visit orthos and get their opinion. Im now looking for experiences from user point of view :)So this is similar to my mouth and I have 20 trays weekly changes and I am sure there will be refinement. I did not think I was bad but apparently my bite is way off on the bottom.Great, thanks for sharing!I had probably a similar degree of straightening needed but once I got scanned, some other things I was not aware of were diagnosed so more is being fixed then I planned. Its fine though.  I just wanted straighter teeth but if all goes well Ill end up with straighter healthier teeth!I think you should definitely get a consultation! That bottom tooth crowding is the kind of crowding that can make it hard to floss, which causes gum issues as you age. My older brother has major gum issues and man  you dont want that. \\n\\nAs others have said, youd likely be able to do Lite! Im on 14 trays / 10 days each, so its not daunting at all. Definitely glad I went ahead with it!My teeth were/are pretty similar and my plan is 25 weekly changes, so just about 6 months. I wont lie, its not fun but I think its worth it for such a short amount of time. Id definitely suggest doing a consult and finding out what the timeline would be for you!I have similar teeth and was told 15 monthsinvisalign will fix it right up. if you have the money and want to, do it.Yes do it. Ive had braces younger but got invisalign because how my teeth looked bothered me as i got older. Best money spent.My crowded teeth affect gums (with age I started to get recession) and my teeth were very sensitive. After Invisalign my tooth sensitivity went down and now I have better flossing habits and intend to keep it because it feels good. My gums are a lot healthierIf bite is not an issue then it\\'s all in your head at this point. No one can tell you what you should value. It needs to come from your own internal compass. Misery is always waiting around the corner....Well its hard to tell like this.\\nThe best thing is to visit an Ortho, and you will have a full detailed answer, cause they will not only look for your anterior crowded teeth, but also the class that you have ( the relation between your upper molar and canine and the lower molar and canine)\\nThis might see easy with the photos that you have sent, but it could be a complex case.\\nIt depends on what would you like to do and how does the Ortho would like to treat your case.\\nInvisalign is a good product as much as SPARK is.\\nIt depends on your Ortho with which brand he works with. \\nI hope my answer helped.iikn\\nIn\\nNIm not an expert, and I usually wouldn\\'t comment on these type of posts- but your mouth looked shockingly almost exactly like mine, so i figured I\\'d tell you my treatment, if it helps. I have 17 trays, and weekly changes with some IPR. Now, I don\\'t have a lot of room in my mouth, and you might. I\\'m also fairly young, and idk how old you are (but I know that matters). There are seemingly dozens of factors that go into one\\'s treatment, so your treatment may look completely different than mine. Consultations are usually free, so go to a couple providers and see what they say :)My bottom teeth were a bit worse than yours, my top were similar, maybe a bit more in line. Im currently on tray set 8 (I think/hope of 24). I had braces in middle school but lost my retainers for 10 years. The most annoying part of invisalign for me is lipstick and gloss gets all over them. Brushing constantly is a little annoying too. But I kept noticing my teeth in the videos I make for social media and its really satisfying seeing results already. I know that when Im done with treatment its going to be worth it. I used to get compliments on my smile all the time post braces, but as my teeth shifted it doesnt happen as often and more importantly Ive noticed a difference too. Im ready to get my my smile back! If the results of Invisalign are something you feel like you would really enjoy and if you notice your teeth and lot and wish they were improved, then I think its worth it! If its just something youre thinking about on a whim or Willy-Nilly, then I wouldnt. While its a product slated for convenience and versatility, its an annoyance thats moderate enough that I feel like you have to be a little results driven to keep up with the tediousness of the treatment. Its also costly, so again, if you feel like it would be something youd really enjoy at the end of treatment, then it would be worth it. Otherwise pass. :)Mine teeth look like yours. I just started 4 weeks ago. They said it would take a year. \\nI have a lisp though when talking right now after talking a long time. Hopefully I get over that.\\nBut even though our case is easier its still going to take 24 traysI\\'m on week 4 as well, it still hasn\\'t gone away ¢Im glad Im not the only one. My savage brother pointed it out to me.If my teeth looked like yours, purely for aesthetic reasons, I wouldnt. Just because I wouldnt think wearing a retainer for the rest of my life would be worth it. But if its important to you and youre willing to put in the work/cash, absolutely go for it!Your teeth will be amazing after completing Invisalign do it!If youre self conscious about it and you can afford it, might as well go for it.  Im all for anything I can do to feel more confident with my body.  I have two weeks to go with my treatment and and Im super happy I went for it.Everyone saying to ask a dentist/ortho is right. My teeth were straighter than yours, I thought I\\'d be fine for Invisalign Lite and I ended up with a Comprehensive plan, 36 initial trays with an estimate of 18-24 months treatment time.Something that might be downplayed when you\\'re being sold Invisalign: you may be wearing a retainer overnight for the rest of your life.  During the pre-sale consultation, this was presented to me as \"you\\'ll have to wear a retainer, but maybe only once a week or so.\"  During the final appointment, same doc said: \"wear this every night, until you no longer want straight teeth.\"\\n\\nIf you **need** them, or if the aesthetics are worth a lifetime of inconvenience, go for it.Your teeth look great as they areI think that no one here can give you an idea of how long it might take. I have seen people with very crooked teeth be done in under a year, and people with teeth that look not that bad take over a year. The only person who could give you a better idea would be an orthodontist who had done an exam. Most offer free consultations and you don\\'t have to go through with the process after the consultation if you don\\'t want to.I\\'d bank on 9 months to a year, even for minor adjustments.  I didn\\'t need much movement and mine was 44 weeks.Best thing I ever did.I had quite a major case. I got 4 teeth extracted as well as an overbite and cross bite. I achieved my results in 16 months. I found having to take them out to brush my teeth and the overall cleaning of them painful but it was still good to be able to eat whatever I liked. Id say consult an orthodontist and go from there. I wouldnt go with a dentist as its not their speciality field. Just my opinion.I have a very similar starting point and mine is Quoted for 15 months (2 week changes)It seems like bite problems take a lot longer to solve than cosmetic problems.  Then again, a lot of people go in for what they think are just cosmetic problems but it turns out that a lot has to be fixed about the bite to change cosmetic.  Not that the two are even mutually exclusive, I just mean in terms of the goals that the person originally had for themselves.  Anyway, Im going in to fix my bite and they say they need to œfix\\x9d the issues I thought were just cosmetic that I dont want to have fixed because I already like my smile.  Its going to take a long time, because the real issue is how my molars come together thats fucking everything.I had a similar starting point and was \\'quoted\\' 13/15 months (but with the change frequency i\\'m going now, will likely be 12/13 months till finish.\\n\\nas if its worth it: depends how much you care I guess, having it is really an inconvenience, and you have to commit for likely a year or so.\\\\`\\n\\nI was always bothered by my teeth not being straight, so I guess it will be worth it when im done (but not gonna lie, having to use this all the time really sucks lol)Your teeth look great I can imagine it would take too long but its hard to know. Depends if you want to go through things like ipr if its not necessaryI had similar issues, but with a bit an overbite as well. I was quoted 12-18 months and finished in 9 months. I think it\\'s definitely worth it to fix the crowding on your bottom teeth, which will only get worse with age.I think you have pretty nice teeth! If you can close your mouth and smile properly, I dont see why you need it.\\n\\n My first treatment plan was 21 trays beweekly changes. My Ortho changed it in the middle with another 21 trays plan that included new IPR so that my bottom front teeth are not triangle shaped (edit: they were like yours) any more and much smaller. I like that very much but someone here experienced bitter regret over that same decision. The truth is that orthodontist just did it without consultation with us, in my case I wanted it. They show you the treatment plan in advance but it goes quickly and this poster didn\\'t get it what it means before it was already done. The difference is dramatic, esp. at first where there are huge gaps between, it can be shocking if that is not exactly what you want.\\n\\nI am at 14/21 now. After this 21 trays finish I will do refinements. It\\'s been 2 years so far, some unexpected things happened: one tooth hurted too much so I went slowly since what I learned here some people rushed, ignored the pain and tooth died! Also I waited for another set to arrive that was during covid time, it took more than month or even more. There were also some other situations when I was less compliant that slowed the process. You can\\'t know and noone can tell you how long it takes. Treatment plan is computer generated and your teeth and bones are alive.\\n\\nTBH I don\\'t get it why it is important how long since this is treatment for life anyway. If you ever stop wearing your retainers you are back to square one in no time!\\n\\nI would recommend it to everyone even if they believe it is purely cosmetics, I believe there are health benefits. Yet some ppl had gum issues, black triangles, unhappy with their face appearance changes, cracked or chipped central incisors. Some ppl had tracking issues. \\nOne person developed serious TMJ/ear issues, but had only minor IPL and kept all their trays, hence was able to return to starting position and issues disappeared.\\n\\n\\nIt is important to be aware of risks and make a decision so that you dedicate to it. This is not ideal solution, things happen. Also it is important to shop around, I visited many orthodontists not only to find the right one for me, but I learned from each visit. It is important that your orthodontist see you and check the progress each 4 trays or so.\\n\\nI dislike just leaving the answer that \"your question has no sense\" without explaining why. You are just asking hoping to learn something. I prefere to either explain or leave no comment.Your teeth have a similar crowded look that mine had. I got Invisalign lite 14 trays and then had an additional 7 refinements. Its a personal decision. Are your teeth awful? No. Could they be straighter? Sure. Its up to youyour issues may be œcosmetic\\x9d now but your teeth will shift throughout your life. My bite was off and I didnt even know it, and the things I didnt like would only get worse with age. Also, my bottom teeth were wearing down significantly fast from ramming against the back of my front teeth. These are things I never would have known without going to an orthodontist.

Beat me to it hahaSame!LOLDating issues before and after invisalignToo relatable. Last date I went on was before Invisalign and that's when I started wondering if my teeth were too crooked so even though I had contemplated Invisalign before, that's when I sort of made the decision to do something about them. Hope it works better once we're all done! LolIf they can't accept you with your Invisalign, they don't deserve the fantastic smile you'll have at the end.Wholesome afYes! This part. °I've had no issues! If you're going on a date and eating food I typically just take my aligners out before I leave and pop them back in when I come home. For hookups (like staying over at someone's) I just keep mine in, my aligners haven't really gotten in the way at all. I see you're also nervous about the appearance but I've found that people don't really notice, I have attachments on almost all of my teeth and haven't had anyone bring it up since they blend into your teeth really well. If they do it's easy to just explain that you have Invisalign and have attachments because of that. I think because we feel the attachments in our mouths all the time they feel very noticeable, however they aren't really noticeable when looking at them irl unless someone is directly staring at your teeth up close. Don't be nervous everything will go great and I promise you no one will think you look hideous ŠThank you for your reply!They dont blend in at all. People are just being kind to you and not pointing out your weird looking teeth. \\n\\nWanna know how I know? Not a single person mentioned anything to me until my SIL had one conversation with me and said œhey you have Invisalign\\x9d. This ish is noticeable to anyone with eyes that work. \\n\\nMy advice for dating, just mention it upfront and it wont be an issue.I guess it may not be as noticeable for me since both my 4 front top and bottom teeth are the only places I don't have attachments but I feel like even if people may notice them they don't look ugly?Oh you dont have attachments on your front teeth?!? Your fine then, seriously nobody really knowsI never realized people were self conscious about invisalign. I gladly tell people I have them if they ask. Whats embarrassing about a person taking care of their teeth? \\n\\nI also see a lot of other guys saying its gay for guys to take care of their skin when its not. Girls love a man that takes care of his body.Me either. I pop them hoes out anytime anywhereSo many people dont notice i have Invisalign until i mention itI guess I'm nervous about meeting someone during the treatment since I am afraid I will look hideous. Im so nervous I was even ready to just give up on dating and wait for my treatment to be over first but then I remembered that even after the treatment I will still wear my trays for 6 months during the day.... I guess Im mostly worried about attachments sticking out and looking weird. Does anyone have any experience with this?Im in a serious relationship and my partner never has an issue!Once you move to retainers they are much less visible because you dont have attachments. Dont worry about that part.They should be happy youre investing in your health and well-being! No shame in invisalignI've just gotten into a relationship and its very new. I started my invisalign after i had gone on maybe 2 dates with this guy. I got IRP done right before the third date and i cancelled the date and told him i was in pain and really upset since the IRP made a lot of very noticeable gaps in my teeth. He was ssooooo understanding and supportive. Im on trays 3 now and he's my boyfriend! lol! Also the trays have never been an issue with hooking up, I just keep them in mostly and everything feels the same. Also he's so cute he's started flossing a lot more and generally taking care of his oral health since he sees me doing it all so often hahaha.I prefer to keep them in my mouth for kissing because my teeth feel like a rock wall otherwise.Yes but it wasnt because of the Invisalign it was because of my personality.The only issue I had was the first 3 days of my first aligner. I was not fun to be around! Im surprised my bf even could stand to be around me. But since then, its no issue. Theyre not truly invisible but they dont make you look hideous. And youll be working towards looking even better! A future partner should be supportive of your choices so it could be a good thing to talk about on dates!Honestly yes attachments are ugly and Invisalign makes my teeth look huge and dorky but I am bettering myself and it takes discipline! I would home my future partner would admire that, and not be turned off by itIf anything, it shows that youre investing in yourself and have amazing dental hygiene?\\n\\nIdk, my partner had Invisalign years before I did and I never cared. It made me feel like he had his life together and I didnt lmaoI date(d) with Invisalign! Both casually and now in my relationship. I had the same fears and it wasnt bad at all. Im good with my trays, so I would take them out right before I went for drinks with someone and then pop them in right after I leave. The first week or two I get new attachments, I only smiled with my mouth closed but then I would forget and relax and its so much easier not to be anxious lol\\nAlso- nobody really notices the attachments! Unless youre literally 2 inches from their face, in which case youre probably kissing and they dont care anyways lol\\nIn my relationship, its not a big deal at all. I Usually leave them in but if Im feeling spicy, I might take them out for a little. After 2 months, he finally noticed my attachments and asked what they were and I told him and he was just like œoh cool\\x9d\\n\\nTL;DR if youre good with your trays, you can do what makes you comfortable (within reason). Otherwise, nobody will notice but you\\n\\nSource: Have had several rounds of trays over 1.5 years (so far) across relationships and casual datingI started Invisalign about 4 months ago and have been on several first/subsequent dates since then. Ive had guys tell me they dont notice my trays if I bring it up at some point. Kissing isnt a problem either, Ive been told they cant feel my attachments/trays (I keep them in). Definitely felt self conscious at first but now I dont care. I just turned 30 this year, and guys around this age dont seem to care or be bothered by it. If they like you enough, theyre probably not gonna be deterred by something temporary like Invisalign esp when its only going to be an improvement for you!Lol my experience is that guys seem to not care if you even have teeth.  (Im kidding sort of) I really worried about this, but in all honestly no one seems to notice or care. I have taken them out for some social events, and when Ive felt insecure, Ive just shared my insecurities like a normal person and that vulnerability has always been well-received. \\n\\nIf a person is turned off by something so superficial, hes not the one for me anyway.Yeah, my wife really frowns on me dating.Im not dating at the moment anyway but I dont plan to start either until treatment is finishedIve noticed I get judged more for the attachments. Ironically my dating life has been really close to non existent since starting and I am not sure if this is coincidental but it is really hard to hold a conversation with girls when I go outIt was never an issue for me. I found that people dont really notice your trays unless you point it out to them.Its a great conversation starter!A year into our relationship I started Invisalign and at first he found it strange to French kiss but after a bit he got used to it and now he doesn't give it a second thought.Im on tray 3 and nobody noticed I have Invisalign unless I told them. Not at work, not at private meetings with friends. My boyfriend didnt notice it for an hour when I got them in. Then I got too impatient and told him. And he knew I was getting them that week.\\nOnce I took them out at the restaurant table at a dinner with a friend, while she was looking at the menu. She didnt notice and still doesnt even know I have Invisalign. I didnt try to hide it all at.I had the same fear when I got mine. I even told my self that the guys I would go out with would be my œInvisalign experiment\\x9d so that it would make me feel better. Happy to say that it doesnt hinder dating the right person. I went on a date with my now boyfriend after having Invisalign for two days. I actually told him about it before the date causally and he totally didnt remember or notice. 9 months in, he just tells me to pop the trays out at the restaurant table and it doesnt bother him. The only thing he doesnt like is when Some trays caused a little pain :) lolI would say slightly yes but mostly no I started my SDC journey a few months into dating my bf and he doesnt mind them at all the thing is clicking them out while we are at dinner is always fun I will mention though one time I gave him a bj and the edge of my aligner cut his penis a bit so pros and cons lmaoI'm in a long term relationship so it really doesn't matter, but I will say that my boyfriend really had to squint and study my teeth to see my attachments, and I have them on pretty much all my front teeth.

Thanks random internet realist.Anything acidic or sugary should be rinsed....otherwise it will sit on your teeth and degrade your enamel or encourage plaque growth.Fuck retainer cleaner. If you need to use something, use denture cleaner, much cheaper same results. Dunking them in cold water has the same effect imho, never hot tho it makes the smell worse and too hot can damage them. Same with your retainers after invisalign, soaking in cold water when not wearing cleans them much better than toothpaste+ brush and that should really just be used for food particles, the majority of it is the cold water soak. Most people who buy dental wax end up not using it after a week or two so only really get it if necessaryI honestly was just told to brush them with toothpaste and so far so good!I was as well but it was really hard to keep them clean on a biweekly schedule. I only ate one time a day to minimize issues. I ended up getting the crest retaininer cleaning tablets which is greatAh Im only on weekly. That makes more sensei have a little bag i take around with a little travel toothbrush, toothpaste, floss and mouthwash and a spare invisalign case just so whenever i eat / drink out of the house i can keep my shit clean, was the best decision ever!!!This!! I bought a clear plastic makeup zipper bag off Amazon. In it I carry a retainer case, toothbrush and toothpaste, floss, a few cleaning tablets for soaking them while Im at work and eating, one of the œkeys\\x9d to remove them with, chewies, and some dental wax. \\nI work long 12-14 hour shifts so most of my care is done at work. \\n\\nI only drink water or sparkling water with them in.On my first tray and here is a list of what I have bought and wish I bought in advance for day 1:\\n\\n\\\\- orthokey: taking off the trays at first can take some time to comfortable with. It gets easier and I can do it with my finger but from reading a bunch of posts it seems that this can be a common occurrence when switching trays \\n\\n\\\\- children\\'s liquid tylenol - i picked this up the 2nd day but wish i had it on hand night one as well as the orthokey. I just rubbed this on my gums when I took the aligners off before eating for about 5 mins. This helped to relieve a lot of the initial plan the first 3 days. Rest of bottle is on hand for future trays just in case.\\n\\n\\\\- chewies - I received one from my provider but it\\'s really hard which is great for setting the trays once in but I find is too hard to chew with for the recommended 30 mins each day. the one I bought from amazon is much softer which helps me actually adhere to the recommended usage time\\n\\n\\\\- clear dish soapatural dish soap: I read and agree with others that this is the easiest way to clean/store the trays when eating at home. I just place them in a glass of cold water and add a drop of dish soap then rinse them after. No smells, no staining thus far\\n\\n\\\\- polident tabs (the 3 min ones since we don\\'t soak overnight) + denture brush: I clean the aligners thoroughly each morning as I find that is when they are the most unpleasant. I have started breaking them in half so the box of 96 should last much longer\\n\\n\\\\- baking soda to protect your enamel (if you drink or eat highly acidic stuff like coffee, wine)  - read a tip here from someone else that their hygienist recommended rinsing with a mix of baking soda + water to help reduce acidity before brushing and/or putting your trays back in. This has been validated with a lot of clinical trials. One of them used about half a teaspoon (3 ml) + 50 ml of water\\n\\n\\\\- reusable straws - attachments will likely stain if you drink beverages like coffee and red wine. Plus sometimes I do want to drink another glass or cup once the trays are in my mouth so if you plan to buy anyways may as well have them on hand day one.I just started Invisalign 4 days ago and these are the best tips. Especially the one about the Childrens Tylenol. Many thanks!If you read through the threads, just know; you might hate it at first. You may feel regret and buyers remorse. It might hurt some, it might not, you might have dry mouth or dry lips, you might talk funny, the attachments feel gross.\\n\\nIt all gets better. It really does. For some its better in a few days or weeks. For me it took probably a month and a half but I did eventually get used to them! Stick with it and good luck!Buy an ortho key/pull tool! It makes taking the trays out so much easier, especially when you just switched trays and theyre a little tight. \\n\\nAlso i learned that white or green tea really doesnt stain your trays that much. And that drinking tea that is too hot will warp them.Just use your fingers. Its so easy to do. Pull from the inside of the teeth instead of the outside. My dentist told me the complete wrong way to pull them out. Look up YouTube tutorialDepending on the size of your mouth and hands, getting them with your fingers isnt super easy. Also if you have short nails or nails that break easy, its hard to get them. Also a tool is cleaner than putting your hands in your mouth sometimes. \\n\\nWith my anatomy the pul tool is a life saver. And its cheap.Yes! I like not having to worry about getting slobber on my fingers! Also, I just throw the tool in the the small bowl when Im soaking my aligner to keep it clean.Yes, my nails are so thin, I couldnt do it without the Pul tool.Ok yeah those are some good points.Ask the ortho for all the supplies before you buy them; they might have a lot they can give you.Have a good lip balm on hand, the first few weeks dried them out so much.Colgate Wisp disposable toothbrush for snacking on the go. Get a teething toy that you can use to set your trays on both sides at once, sometimes chewies will seat one side but the other will pop off so I found have something I could do both sides of the rear molars at the same time really helpful.  \\n\\n\\nAnd, get a small travel bag and keep essentials like toothbrush, toothpaste, flossers, and a small mouthwash with you at all times.\\n\\nA denture bath and some denture cleaner while you are in the shower and put them in right after will keep them clean without having too much out of mouth time.\\n\\nI found orthokeys a waste of time. I also found using the chewies a few times a day kept me tracking very well. The very first day is the worst. Just stick it out.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI drunk anything I wanted to in mine that was cold, and just did a cold water rinse after I was done and never had any staining or enamel loss or integrity issues with my aligners.Drink coffee, drink tea, live your life normally just keep away from sugar while you have the aligners in. If youre switching trays every week then who cares if they get a little yellow quicker ? Youll be switching out for clean pair shortly after. If youre going out drinking Id suggest using the old pair for the night then switching back into the clean weeks pair the next day. Good luck!Agree not to worry about staining unless it really bothers you. But coffee is also acidic so whilst some people do have it with trays which can be fine for some/most, one should be mindful of this and regularly swill with water at minimum.dont hot drinks just ruin the shape of them tho so u cant have coffee or tea?Unless you\\'re having boiling tea and coffee, it won\\'t make a difference for invisalign. I thing that only happens to the cheap materials from other brands.my ortho told me not to have hot drinks and i always avoid washing them with hot water too, surely anything above 40 degrees C will warp them cos theyre designed for body temp ??? i mean what do i know tbf im just being extra carefulNo it doesnt morph the aligners, just dont drink it boiling hotGot floss for work and when I am outside and a water jet floss for homeYes! I always recommend floss picks to our patients because they can just stick a few in their case without having to carry around a spool.\\n\\nYou can drink most things that are sugar and acid free- and if things are pigmented I tell our patients to use a straw. Sparkling water is fine too as long as there is no citric acid!\\n\\nBest of luck on your journey!Hydrogen peroxide and hot water does wonders for cleaning themFinishing up tray 32/32 with refinements on the way. Lemon water is fine. Most everything short of like eating gum or similar is fine. \\n\\nMy advice would be to just not think about it too much or worry. Brush when you can. If you cant just make sure to rinse off your trays and rinse out your mouth. The biggest thing to keep in mind is very sugary foods/drinks. Much like regular teeth hygiene, sugar is the last thing you want sticking around in your teeth.

I think I want to do it, but I want to be sure before investing in it.Ask those same people who say your gap looks good, if they would get their teeth fixed of theirs looked like yours. I suspect you would get a different answer.I think you should go for it. If youre worried about your teeth shape when youre done, your dentist or ortho may very well shave down the teeth so they dont look œbeaver\\x9d like as you say.If its going to make YOU feel more confident, and happier it is worth it. Dont listen to anyone who says otherwise, its about what you want.If you did youd get bonding on the teeth either side to even out the length.I personally really do love the character of a gap, but if its something that makes someone feel self conscious then change it up.they will probably also pull down and angle the teeth beside your front teeth so everything will look balanced. I had teeth that had not descended fully and Invisalign worked really well for that!Those are platitudes. If I say \"should I wear make-up?\" Everyone will say \"no you are beautiful how you are!\" people are being polite. \\n\\nThe real answer is yes, close that gap and straighten those lower teeth. \\nThe crooked bottom teeth usually leads to other issues like plaque build up or difficulties flossing, or easily chipped teeth. A gap is usually considered cute on little children, some young women who are models with youthful features. On most people, a gap will make people treat you like a child, and will increase tooth chipping risk.Do it. I had the same gap. People said I looked like Michael Strahan and forest Whitaker. I said cool, but I don\\'t have Strahan/Whitaker money.

I am glad you are having the results you want!Your gap looks similar to mine btw, you may need to get a \"maxillary midline frenectomy\" which will prevent that gum tissue between your front teeth from coming back and ruining the results. My ortho has referred me off to a periodontist to have that done at the end of my treatment.Edit: I just saw your reply to a comment below about not smiling. I think if thats the case you should get rid of the gap. I did Invisalign because I had a tooth that stuck way out and I have not smiled with my teeth since it came in that crooked. No matter how much people say they think its cute or like it you probably wont feel the same. I am officially smiling with my teeth more often now even though the tooth is still a little crooked.

Good luck \\x9dï¸\\x8f\\n\\nPersonally I love a gap! My husband has one (a little less than yours) and its my favorite thing. Now if you dont like the gap then by all means get rid of it. On the other hand maybe you could talk to your dentist/ortho about only slightly narrowing the gap? If you like the way that looks maybe you could do refinements at the end to close it more if you werent happy with it still. My friend had her gap only slightly closed and shes really happy she didnt go all the way. In the end I think its up to you. However if someone says they like the gap believe them because its true ºï¸\\x8fI really appreciate your perspective on both sides of this. I do believe some people genuinely like gaps.

They add a unique quality to a person and Im sad when I see them closed. However, if you dont like your smile and its not practical for you, then get Invisalign.I basically never smile with my teeth showing because I am self conscious of my teeth, mainly the gap.

You are not smiling with your teeth because you don\\'t like your smile. I had a big gap but had it reduced and not completely closed.Do it then. A lifetime of being self conscious about your smile is the answer to your question.

(Got invisalign in 2021.) Getting the gap fixed was the single most dramatic change I have ever made to my appearance. I was able to date higher echelon guys, married one of them, doors opened more easily in my career. Getting my gap fixed altered the course of my life.Invisalign and lasik were the two best things I\\'ve ever done for myself. Invisalign is much easier than people often make it seem on this sub.\\n\\nI recommend getting Invisalign. I didn\\'t realize how much my teeth needed to be improved or how much I thought about it until I was a few months into Invisalign and really started to see the progress. It is expensive though and is also a commitment-- so make sure you\\'re ready for those aspects before diving in.\\n\\nNo harm in getting another consult. Just make sure to go to a respected orthodontist and never just a dentist. \\n\\nBest of luck with whatever you decide.>Invisalign is much easier than people often make it seem on this sub.\\n\\nInvisalign is fine because I was at home for the last 1.5-2 years. If I wasn\\'t at home it would be a big inconvenience, if you carry a purse around its better but you still have to duck out to a restroom or car to take them off before eating/drinking.  \\n\\n\\nIMO braces are easier to live with than invisalign but theyre very visible. Pros and cons to each.To each their own. I had braces (top front teeth were ceramic, back and lowers were metal) in my early 20\\'s and I have Invisalign now in my mid-30\\'s. I would never do normal braces again after experiencing Invisalign. \\n\\nWhen I had normal braces, I still had to brush after every meal. Otherwise, you risk staining. Also, when I had rubber bands with braces, I had to take those out before eating. It takes 2 seconds to pop out my aligners with Invisalign -- about the same effort as removing those rubber bands I had with braces. \\n\\nTo me, the benefits of Invisalign greatly outweigh braces.You are so correct, I wished I had started when everyone was WFH! Everything would have been less stressful, as no one was going to dinner, coffee, bars, etc. Unfortunately, with the anchors on my teeth, I have a hard time getting them off, on week 3. However, as someone said before, at week 3 you kinda start accepting the foreign object in your mouth lol!Do it if you got the money.I think that you will not regret your decision once youve done it,  time flies by pretty fast,  the only thing is it you can afford it ficially or not and if you are ready to put up with some inconveniences (pain, remove trays when you eat, etc)Youll need a frenectomy first to get rid of the extra skin in between the gap then Invisalign! I had it done no pain but I hated my gap so much more confident without it but its your choice !!I think when I had my consultation a year ago they mentioned the frenectomy. They said its quick thing to fix.I had bonding on my two front teeth 10 years before I had invisalign and they never clipped mine.I think that peoples teeth look best when theyre a bit œindividual\\x9d, so you still look like you. I like the gap. \\n\\nIm fixing all my bottom teeth that are jammed together so close I couldnt even floss, but leaving the longer length on the top front two so theyll still look a bit œimperfect\\x9dShould close it and straighten your teeth. Look like a completely different personIve got a similar gap, I got a consultation and instead going with standard metal braces and having a small procedure to remove gum between the gap so they fully close, you also look like youd need the same procedure to fully close up, but actually doing it is up to you, Ive been self conscious about my gap all my life, if youre the same thats youre answer. If you do want to get rid of it, start now and thank yourself later if you started a year ago when you had first consultation it would probably be near enough closed nowI definitely have been self conscious about it for a long time. I guess that alone should make the decision easier, but its still not an easy decision for me for some reason.If it bothers you, then go for it! Its an investment in yourself. Cant go wrong with that. Personally my bottom teeth were terrible & it gave me self confidence issues. Especially when I heard some of my friends talking about another coworker that said hes cute but his bottom teeth are jacked. Mine were way worse than that. I wonder if my friends were saying the same thing about my teeth. I didnt think my top teeth were too bad until they were straight. It changed my whole face in a good wayI\\'m a 41M who started Invisalign because I am still dating. I feel self conscious about my smile. I\\'ve been on it for 4 months and although I\\'m only on tray 10/26,  I feel really good about the change I have seen and that I am dong something about my smile instead of living with what I don\\'t like.\\n\\nThe quote is $5,000 and every three months I visit the orthodontist it is $141. it is not covered by my dental insurance. For me,  it was worth it.  I have had LASIK and enjoy that I do not need glasses anymore unless reading and programming. Both the Invisalign and LASIK are cosmetic for me. I\\'ve embraced the idea that I need a little help in looking my best.\\n\\nBetween us guys (and everyone on Reddit),  I have teeth like yours minus the front gap.  The neater your teeth are,  the more refined you look.  It \"gentrifies\" and \"cleans up\" your appeal and presentation. Unfortunately prettier and handsome people are received better. If others have commented or stared at your teeth,  you should get it.\\n\\n**If you decide to do it,  specifically go to an orthodontist.**  Don\\'t go for the cheap specialists,  as they are not trained for all situations,  and I am not sure why they are allowed to offer Invisalign.I appreciate your input! Honestly one of the bigger reasons I am considering this is because I am hoping it will help attract more female attention. I know that may not seem like a great reason to some people but its the truth at least lol.It is a great reason.  Lets be realistic,  looks count.  Get the Invisalign,  it\\'s a great cosmetic boost.\\n\\nWish I had the money when I was in my 20s.I say yesAs someone who got Invisalign based on a comment from someone else, please dont care what anyone else says in doing it! Mine was just one tooth that I didnt like, and they so happened to point it out. I dont regret it at all, but wish I spent more time understanding how much time it would take etc. and that I made the decision more so for myself. I think its totally preference, some people will think the gap is unique and really love it, others will think the opposite. End of the day all you can do is decide what you think would make you feel better! Every other person told me I didnt need it for the record. \\nIf you got a consult did they show you what your scan would look like after treatment? This might be helpful to see if youd like to know what it might look like! \\n\\nSorry for the ramble! All the best either way!Honestly nobody I personally know has given me a negative comment about the gap, but I dont think any of them would either way. I think they probably know Im a bit self conscious about it and wont say anything too blunt thinking they might offend me. Its just hard to know for sure what the people in your everyday life really think when it comes to something like this because you know they dont want to upset you. I can understand making the decision after someone comments on it directly like they did yours, but Im happy you dont regret getting Invisalign after that. Thanks for sharing your experience.so the choice is yours! and all the best!   \\ns feeling very conscious about my smile and over the years I could see the gap widening. I always felt that it was a huge cost and just the process would be cumbersome, But as the pandemic hit, it made it easier to go through the process and I was able to save up some money on Commute. There is a permanent or temporary retainer you might have to wear for the rest of your life.   \\nSo think about these 4 factors :   \\n1. Its a commitment for a few months, brushing, flossing, and also the discomfort of trays  \\n2. It might cost you anywhere between 2000 dollars to up to ...ugh i dunno 7000 dollars   \\n3. you will have to wear some kind of retainer after you are done with the trays for the rest of your life to maintain your newly aligned teeth  \\n4. Your friends and family will have mixed opinions about how your previous smile made you unique ( now that you have lost the gap)\\n\\nso the choice is yours ! and all the best!Some people feel their gap is part of who they are, makes them unique- if this is you: then no. If not, absolutely get Invisalign!Go for it. From what Ive read, gaps arent physiologically healthy in the long run.A lot of people forget to consider that teeth move over time. What\\'s barely acceptable \\\\[ to you \\\\] now, may be quite a lot worse in 5 years time, and you will be thinking you should have fixed them 5 years ago.\\n\\nIt will never be cheaper and easier than right now to fix them.Well, in my humble opinion youd look better if the gap wasnt there, so I say go for it. Also, if I were you (implying that cost & inconvenience werent obstacles), Id go for it as well. BUT many people appreciate their imperfections, and if youre one of them you shouldnt do Invisalign just to look better in other peoples eyes. Do what makes you happy!Ive had a gap my whole life, oddly enough was never made fun of in school or at any part of my life over it. Always was told I had a nice smile but when I took a photo I never showed my teeth and if I did Id notice right away and would hate the photo. Do it because you want to do it! Im still currently in the process and not loving my teeth still but hopefully I will when my journey is complete. Its a shame we see gaps in peoples teeth and always notice it and make fun of others because they arent straight, perfect and abnormally white. Society sadly makes us believe a œ standard for beauty œ but if it will make you happy go for it! Life is short :) I personally love your teeth! But again not about me, its about you and your happiness! ( Amy Winehouse, Mac Miller and Madonna all had gaps and personally they looked beautiful with them. Love yourself!I wouldn\\'t omit the gap, but making it smaller might be nice. Also, you\\'d get to straighten out your bottom teeth too.It depends on what you want! Personally, I decided to get mine primarily because of my gap, I always hated it!I\\'m on tray 5 out of 24. I have a similar gap and I think it does add to my uniqueness. I was concerned about my bottom teeth so I told my ortho I wanted to keep a small gap in the top and he said when I feel the gap is good enough we will stop and rescan if necessary. I was very conscious and nervous about invisalign but my bottom teeth were very separated and I think I made a wise decision without compromising my oral health and looks. Hope it helps.As someone who was fairly comfortable with my teeth before, do it, you wont regret itMy teeth were always my thing thar I obsessed over even though all things considered they werent œthat bad\\x9d. Had then straightened and tbh, theyre not perfect but theyre good enough. Have never thought twice about the cost on Invisalign because for me it was worth it in the end.You can keep the gap and we can still help you achieve more balance and harmony in your smile. \\n\\nDo you have a reverse smile arc as well as differences in the alignment of your upper teeth and a missing tooth in the upper left. Your lower incisors show moderate crowding as well simply aligning your teeth will bring more balance and harmony to your face. You can even keep the gap and balance it. \\n\\nWhere does the gap come from? Does the gap run in your family? Do you have a low hanging frenum or possibly an extra tooth called a mesiodens? \\n\\nAn orthodontist can help you with all of this, I highly recommend you go visit one certified by the board of orthodontics. A board-certified orthodontist has gone through the highest rigors of testing and proving their knowledge sufficient to have board certification.Yes, do it!I would close it if I were you.I think your gap is dope. If closing it would make you feel more confident then go for it, but I think it looks really good.Honestly if it bothers you do it! I had an overbite for most of my life and people would always tell me oh its not bad at all. I finally budged and straightened my teeth the confidence boost I got was unbelievable! I am no longer afraid of smiling ºï¸\\x8fI did Invisalign and made my gap smaller. But didnt close it all the way. You dont have to close it completely if you like it! I hated mine growing up now I love my gap. But it was def œtoo big\\x9d lol.Do it up!! You wont regret it. Well, for the first couple weeks youll be like omg what did I do ‚ but after that- no regrets!My middle daughter has a gap. I love it but if she wants to fix it when older its up to her. I think your gap is great and characterful and perhaps the lower teeth would be good a little straighter but its totally up to you. Only you know if its something that would add value to your lifeI say go for it ! I\\'m on tray 6 of 32 I have a deep bite . I was supposed to get braces as a child like many of us on here . My dentist suggested it because my teeth were applying so much pressure to my jaw and teeth that eventually my teeth would come out. When I\\'m done with my trays I am going to ask my dentist to shape my front teeth because they have those weird ridges(not sure what they\\'re called)  . They will have to file in between some space for some trays (I didn\\'t know that until I had it done ) anyhow I think you should do it for you and not worry about what everyone else thinks. We all have to start thinking about what we like instead of other peoples opinions. ºï¸\\x8fGo for it, you considered doing it but the opinions of others got to you. I was conscious of my smile and everyone said dont do it, but Im so happy I got Invisalign. The same people saying g my smile looks good. I think a good smile is priceless and the best thing you can do. If I was you yes I would do it.Do it! You wont regret. I promiseI made the decision to close mine at 51. If you smile alot in pictures showing teeth keep the gap and straighten the bottom. In my case I never smiled in pictures even as kid. I\\'m 33 weeks/ 7 months in with invisalign. Now that my gap is pretty much closed I smile now with attachment and retainers on.I seriously dont think a picture exists of me smiling with my teeth showing. I have received so much feedback from this post and I grateful for it. It has made the decision easier. I called and have an appointment on Monday to get scans done and Im going to proceed with this.I love your gap :)  F\\\\*\\\\*k Invisalign!  (I haven\\'t been that thrilled with my experience)Thank you Š. Im not sure I love it as much as you do though. What has your experience been like, if you dont mind me asking?Yeah, if you don\\'t love it then I suggest you change it up.  I really love the character, I think it\\'s so lovely.\\n\\nI\\'m being a whiner, my experience hasn\\'t been all that bad I suppose.  However, if I could go back in time, I would totally opt out.\\n\\nI am a 38 female, I had braces as a teenager so my teeth were fairly straight to begin with.  Because I haven\\'t been wearing a retainer like a chump, my teeth have slightly shifted and became misaligned.  Because my teeth are misaligned, I\\'m really biting down harshly on my left incisors and canine.  This bite is causing my gums to recede at a bit of an alarming rate.\\n\\nI initially was told it was $5000 CAD all in - my insurance would cover half, my dentist\\'s black Friday deal and would cover a quarter, so it\\'s fairly inexpensive for me to have this treatment.\\n\\nI started the Invisalign treatment, was told it would be 17 weeks.  The upper trays always felt a little loose, especially on my back teeth.  I was told my back uppers are crowns so they could not put the buttons or attachments on those teeth.  I believe that\\'s what caused them to be loose.  Almost a spongey kinda mouth feel.  Anyhoo!  I had four weeks left and noticed tray 13 felt more than a little loose on my back teeth.  I was told \"oh it\\'s fine, this can happen\".  I moved on to tray 14 which felt more loose than 13.  I went into the dentist and the hygienist/dental assistant put the tray under hot water and bent my Invisalign backwards thinking it would solve the problem.\\n\\nI just trusted them.  Who wouldn\\'t?!\\n\\nI\\'m feeling the home stretch as tray 15 goes on - but notice that my buttons (attachments) are not in place.  Back to the dentist I go.  They rescan my mouth and in two weeks, when I should be getting my Invisalign off, I\\'m getting another 12 weeks worth of trays.\\n\\nSupersonic annoying.  My new trays came with blue dots on the back teeth, which really are nice and snug on those crowns :)\\n\\nI guess to rain a little more on the Invisalign parade:  They are also not at all invisible, are difficult to speak in and was \\\\*JUST\\\\* told that I will need to wear a retainer everyday for a year after i\\'m through with Invisalign.  I\\'m super annoyed but hey \\\\*maybe, just maybe\\\\* i\\'ll be better to my gums.My opinion, is I like the gap it looks attractive.The two things Id consider are its harmony with your face and facial proportions (which we cant see here, there are celebrities that rock the front tooth gap), and whether it would help your confidence or not make much of a difference.Are you open to getting metal or ceramic braces or only Invisalign? I have clear and metal Damon braces for my severe crowding and they moved my teeth so fast.If I had a gap I wouldnt close it. I think as long as its ok for the over health of your teeth and purely cosmetic, there is no point. They are charming and unique. They add character. I vote keep it! But at the end of the day, if its a large source of insecurity, then close it.Get it done. Mine was so bad I had to do cosmetic dentistry to get it fixed. And I should have gotten it done way before I did.Its really up to you. If you like your gap, and its causing you no issues, you should keep it! \\n\\nIf it bothers you, get Invisalign :) \\n\\nIf it were me, I would want Invisalign. \\n\\nIve been thinking about how I would explain braces to my children if they ever need to get them; on the one hand Im hoping that they see and believe that looks are superficial. On the other hand, society judges people on looks and can even determine opportunities that are available to you. Teeth seems to be a big one. So just for those reasons, I would consider working on my teeth.\\n\\nETA they will make them look amazing when youre all done. Even if they look œbeaverish\\x9d, they can fix that too. Just look through all the before and afters here.Some people love their gaps, and some people hate them. Its hard for me to judge and say what I think you should do because I cant see your whole face. However, if they were my teeth, Id close the gap. \\n\\nIf you find yourself hiding your teeth or avoiding smiling because of the gap, get them fixed. If youre not self conscious about it, or if you like it, leave it.I had a crooked front tooth and crowding on the bottom front two teeth kind of like yours. i ended up getting invisalign mainly because I am an actor and fixing my crookedness makes me feel more comfortable being on camera.\\n\\nMy smile was never too bad and I always had people saying my smile is \"perfect\" \"beautiful\" etc. even when I had the crowding and crookedness. But I went ahead with invisalign for my own self love and acceptance and I haven\\'t been happier. I look at my smile now and feel like if i would have listened to others\\' thoughts i would always be secretly unhappy and judging myself.\\n\\nDon\\'t let others\\' thoughts about how you look keep you from creating a version of you that you\\'re happy with.its completely up to you but i say go for it! i had (have?) a large v-shaped gap in between my two front teeth and it made me so self conscious, i decided to go with Invisalign because it was suggested to me by my dentist and i dont regret my decision at all! my teeth are already halfway to touching and i only started mid-december! im already starting to become more confident and im not even half way done :)I am on tray 11/24 and closing a 3mm gap! I am 29 and have held onto the gap as part of my identity but have always wished I had a smile I felt confident about. Other people say they love my gap and I DO love that it gives my smile character, but for me I feel like it makes me look goofy when I smile and its always been something Im insecure about, as much as Ive tried to force myself to love it. Ironically I think gaps are so cute on others. Not to be too much of a broken records but as others have said its about your preference! Do you spend more days hating your smile than loving it? Also, you could probably keep your gap and treat everything else, or close the gap slightly to make it smaller. When I went in for consultation they told me they have some clients that plan treatment AROUND keeping their gap because they love it. Just a thought!Youd probably be a really good candidate. I recommend itI had big gaps and an open bite and in the refinement stage. You should do it I dont regret it one bit! You wont either. I love the gap. How do you feel about it?Coming from someone who also has a gap, Id close it. Im on tray 9/14 and its almost closed. Feels pretty insane how much of a difference it makes in your life. \\n\\nMy bf is sad because he loves my gap and its super sweet but I couldnt care less  its about me and what I want. Do what you want to have the best confidence in yourself everyday!I felt my spacing looked hick-ish and hated smiling in pictures because of it, so ask yourself how you feel about it, not others. I dont think your teeth will look too big pushed together but you can talk to the orthodontist about bonding to make your lateral incisors longer.I put off for years fixing my crooked bottom teeth. Many dentists suggested braces. Im fixing them now at age 57 with SureSmile. I should have done it years ago. A great smile is worth a million bucks. Im also doing this to protect my gums and correct a protruding back tooth.You can get them done but keen diastema. I have a patient keeping the front gap but otherwise wide ING the smile!My canines are set far forward and up high, and are quite pointy. When I would talk to people about getting braces or Invisalign, they would always say my vampire teeth are cute/unique/part of me. But I spent years hating my teeth, not smiling in pictures (œno REALLY smile, with your teeth!\\x9d), and feeling self conscious. Even as Ive gotten older and learned to embrace them a little more, I still felt like they make me less attractive, look less professional, etc., so I decided it doesnt matter if theyre part of my unique look. Theyre not a part of the look I want. I just started five weeks ago so I have a long way to go, but I cant wait to have a non-unique smile. When it comes down to it, its 100% your choice and you should do what makes you feel good!i would align both upper and lower but id do it with traditional bracesWhy would you suggest traditional?I had very similar teeth when I started out with Invisalign.

See your health care providerMy health care provider said he cant tell but due to just getting dental work its likely angular cheilitus but IDKY there are small pustules[deleted]Same. This looks like a coldsore, because of the bubbles. You can buy light machines that either completely get rid of the sore, or at least speed up healing.

Don't wait to get it tested so you know and you can inform your partner(s).Nm, just read a later comment of yours saying you had cold sores in the past. You won't need a doctor to test you then unless you want treatment.Looks like a cold soreI agree it might be a cold sore (Ive never had one so Im not sure), but it looks exactly like the rash I get around my mouth when I eat mangos. It has tiny blisters just like poison ivy rash.I get that from eating mangoes too. I now believe its an allergy, not cold sores (after years of treating it for cold sores and it not working). Now I cut the mangoes up and pop the pieces right in my mouth without touching my lips and never have a problem.Might be angular cheilitis. My doctor prescribed a steroid cream. I mix the steroid cream and an OTC fungal cream and put it on the infected area. It should resolve within a week.

If you had cold sores as a kid, its probably just resurfacing!I've heard the some people get what's called Angular Cheilitis. It's basically a fungal infection. Otc fungal creams will work or you can see a Dr and get a prescription.

The drool just provides a moist environment. It doesn't happen every time I drool.Cold sore/herpes\\nCommon after any dental work unfortunately. Can happen when dental providers dont wash hands or tools correctly.Did you experience any itching or tingling?No I didnt, when I used to get cold sores when I was younger I almost always got tingling whereas this went from irritation to thisMight be a cold sore. Herpecin L or Abreva can work wonders on cold sores.\\nIf you can see your doctor soon, they can prescribe an anti-viral that will help reduce symptoms, although they are less effective the later you take them.Herpes.. valacyclovirIts a cold sore, a form of herpes, but nothing to be alarmed about.

Best money I could have spent to keep me somewhat sane those first few days.In the meantime the wax around Babybel/cheese is very similar to dental wax as it has a similar melting point. This is what I tell patients at my practice to use if they are in a pinch and cant get to us to pick some up.This satisfies two needs: my love for cheese and the need for my tray hooks to not cut into the inside of my mouth. Thank you!!You got wax with yours? I had to buy my own \\xadYou probably could have asked the ortho for some! I havent needed wax at all. I just filed any spiky points.Different when they put metal attachments in for your elastics. It will tear your cheek to shreds. I didn't know how painful it was until it happened ¦True true!Damn your ortho is nice. I pay a premium to go to a top National provider in Beverly Hills and all I got was a sample of floss.I didnt get much eitherChewies to help get your trays in tight and wax in case they rip your cheeks to shreds lolI wished I got wax when they put my metal attachments in. It was so painful when they ripped my cheek to shreds ¦Honestly the only reason I knew to even go buy some is bc I had traditional braces before so I figured Id at least be prepared if I needed it. I wish they would have given it to me too but they gave me a bunch of cleaner.The plastic ones also rip your mouth up if that makes you feel better.What is dental wax?**Waxes are a diverse class of organic compounds that are lipophilic, malleable solids near ambient temperatures.  They include higher alkanes and lipids, typically with melting points above about 40 Â°C (104 Â°F), melting to give low viscosity liquids.**\\n\\nMore details here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wax> \\n\\n\\n\\n*This comment was left automatically (by a bot).

Youre supposed to chew on them for your trays to properly sit. I never liked them cause they put extra stress on your jaw. Try it and see how it feelsThanks!I found these really helpful. When i would switch trays and use the chewies with the new tray, i could feel the tray click in a little more than just using my fingers. Would recommend.The lower box is wax. you can take a tiny piece and stick it anywhere that is rubbing against your cheek or tongue. most people don't need it, but just in case you have a bracket or a cut in your traysFYI, I ended up ordering WAY more chewies than this! Get a giant bag!Same.  Still finding some all over the house, car & work.Tampons, for when your gums bleedChewies to seat the aligners properly and dental wax to protect and sharp edges that might cause discomfortThe clear stuff is orthodontic wax ” you can put it on the aligners if there is a rough edge you cant file away so it doesnt cut your mouth.

I am a week out from getting it and I am being silly thinking about scenarios, E.g.not wanting to taking job opportunities that are overly client facing for fear that my Invisalign bumps and elastics will look unprofessional. \\n\\nDid anyone else have a similar level of self-consciousness? How did it play out in your day to day?\\n\\nEdit: thanks so much for the reassurance, guys! 95% of comments have affirmed that no one (but yourself) really care or notice :)I mean this in the nicest way possible, no one but you cares. During my 6 month course not a single person mentioned my Invisalign at all, and I work in a very client facing job. They either just didnt notice, or if they did didnt bother to say anything, cause it really makes no difference to anyone but you.This exactly! I work in a client facing job and really no one said anything. If i need to have meals with my clients, I just excuse myself to go to the bathroom to remove my trays. No one ever asked me about my teeth in the last 1.5 years.I second this. I also work in a very client facing position and it\\'s become a talking point for me because a lot of my clients also have it. Otherwise, almost nobody notices and when they do they say \"oh, I thought you had perfect teeth before\" which just shows how little they actually pay attention because one of my teeth was literally behind the others.Worry not. Till today, no body has asked me until I told people myself - either they didnt notice or they noticed but didnt want to ask. The necessity to tell people comes only during adhoc snacking. In fact, things will become second nature after a few weeks. \\n\\nThe only thing that matters is Does your teeth look better this week (or fortnight) compared to last? The answer will always be yes and this will keep motivating you. Good luck[deleted]This!! Family members are always offering me food etc. completely forgetting I have my Invisalign in!I totally feel you on this! I\\'m 4 months into my treatment and I was SUPER self-conscious at first- avoiding dinner plans, etc. \\n\\nThat said- truly in the best way, no one cares. By far the most common reaction to telling people that I\\'ve started Invisalign is \"wait I\\'ve wanted to get Invisalign too\" and they point out some little issue with their teeth that\\'s totally unnoticeable to anyone but them. Everyone is their worst critic and we notice things on ourselves that no one else even realizes! The trays are not invisible at all - especially with the attachments- but since they\\'re clear, they\\'re definitely not blatant. If you take them out for a dinner or anything, chances are no one will even notice the attachments. \\n\\nWhat\\'s helped me too is that this allll temporary. It\\'s way better than hating my teeth and smile and covering my mouth with my hand whenever I laugh, as I\\'ve done the last 10ish years. It\\'ll be over before you know it (aside from retainers at night!) and you\\'ll forgotten how self conscious you were for a year. Dont let it stop you from being social- genuinely people will be happy for you doing this for yourself. And wearing masks 1000% helps too!Barely anyone notices mine and I have attachments on my front teeth. I went ahead and told everyone at work just to avoid the awkward talk in the bathroom of why I\\'m brushing my teeth. The way I think about it is I was embarrassed the way my teeth looked before invaslign, so why should I be embarrassed with invaslign. I\\'m taking the proper steps to fix my smile if anything I should smile moreAlmost no one notices mine u less they have it themselves or if they do notice they don\\'t say anything. Life is too short not to take and enjoy opportunities because of a bit of plastic on your teeth. \\x81I saw a friend of mine prior to this professional conference I attended earlier this week, and she said something like \"I thought you\\'d sound different with Invialign but I can\\'t tell at all.\"  At the conference, I had many conversations with people while at breakfast or lunch, and no one asked/commented about my smile or attachments, though at first I did wonder whether they notice the attachments or not. Invisliagn and braces are nothing knew. Plenty of adults get them all the time. Honestly, if anything, you are showing your clients/coworkers/boss that you are spending your money, time, and effort into improving yourself, so it should be seen as something positive. Don\\'t pay attention to people who say otherwise.You don\\'t have to worry at all. My first week i was saying my teeth hurt because of my braces and everyone was looking at me telling me that i don\\'t have any. \\n\\nBiggest confidence boost ‘ŒI know the general consensus is œpeople wont notice\\x9d. I recently saw some coworkers in person for the first time since getting Invisalign and they did happen to notice. Guess what? It wasnt a big deal. They asked if I had invisalign, some said they were interested in getting it and had a few more questions. There is absolutely nothing unprofessional about taking care of your teeth.I totally understand! \\nIve been to the office twice this week & no one has said anything. I dont know if they havent noticed or havent said anything. Either way, it suits me cos I dont want to be talking about it & I am not a person who wants to be showing everyone. \\nI gave myself a few days to help get my talking in order also & just generally feel used to it.\\nAnd go to the bathroom to take them in and out, that works better for me.\\nYou do you & take your time to find your own path :)Honestly props to you all in these replies. Im a year in and fully avoid talking to people without my mask on ……Honestly don\\'t sweat it. I work in an office and have clients coming in and out of my office all day long. I started my treatment in December of 2021 and to this day, not one person has asked about them or pointed them out. The only time it has ever come up is if I mention it. I\\'m currently on 15/40.Nobody\\'s ever noticed or commented on the Invisalign during the 18 months I\\'ve had it.  Really the only people that pick up on it are other Invisalign users.  ;-)People have asked why I have bumps on my teeth. They wont say anything at first which will make you think they dont notice but they definitely know. They wont say anything until theyre more comfortable with bringing up the subject around you.For my initial course, no one really noticed unless I said something and I had type II elastics. \\n\\nFor my refinements I\\'ve had to have an attachment put on my front tooth and I hate it. You can\\'t really see it when my aligners are out but when they\\'re in it looks like a weird square on my tooth. I don\\'t know, I\\'ve just sucked it up and tried not to smile too much. I have to say, it has improved my teeth massively though.It really depends on the lighting, honestly. Sometimes theyre super noticeable on people and sometimes they arent.think about the dozens of people youve seen who have invisalign. if you doubt youve seen dozens then thats because you have never noticed their teeth. youll be fine!The lisp is the only thing I\\'m conscious of.  It seems to reoccur mostly when my mouth gets drier.Yup definitely suffer from this too. People notice and look at me weird.Only people who ever noticed for me were people who had it themselves at some point.No one notices mine. I dont mind smiling cause you cant see it. My lisp comes out a bit when my mouth is dry, thats the only thing Im self conscious aboutNo one cares lol. Most people dont even notice it, and if they do they thinks ita nice that your taking the time to better yourself.Honestly nobody really cared it was more of a me thing but on mornings that were meeting heavy Id leave them out and then just put them back in after. It was nbd. Especially with masks nobody cares lolYes me too. My whole life everyones always stared at my lips when I talk so now people stare at my teeth instead.. so I dont really smile in pictures. I cant wait till its over because I hate having a dry mouth and my lips sticking to the alignersDitto everyone who has replied lol\\n\\nI was excited about picking up my trays but was horrified upon seeing my teeth on the monitor and finding out Id have attachments on every single tooth. After I left the ortho, I was low key freaking out bc I kept thinking, œBut these are so not invisible?!!\\x9d LOL. Anyway, I was still self conscious for the first few weeks but ended up going on dates anyway. Id take the initiative to mention them (as a reason for why I wasnt eating, etc.) and my dates would tell me they didnt even notice them Â¯\\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ \\n\\nFast forward 4 months later, I literally dont give a thought to whether people notice them anymore. All I know is, my teeth look better than before so yay!Having to wear a mask all year helped in those moments. But honestly, most people wont notice or care.Im in vacation in Florida and just met up with some friends for dinner. No one noticed anything. A very minor inconvenience and a little planning is all it takes.I would notice it. And I would think it was super cool. Because go you for doing something for yourself, and go you for doing something so many people want to do but cant or wont.Literally the only two people who have asked me either have it themselves or are interested in it.I had the same thoughts and concerns for about two days after I got the invisalign put on. I felt that I was lisping, though others repeatedly assured me I was not. After two days, I could no longer hear or \"feel\" the (negligible) lisp. \\n\\nOne of the things that spurred me to get invisalign was my dislike of how my teeth looked on video, as I had a more client-facing job last year. People who knew me then/saw the videos assured me that they saw nothing wrong with my teeth at *that* time either. Overall, I think people are less observant (and certainly less concerned) than you might think.Im 1 month in and in about two weeks I has to present research to over 200 people globally. I dont care much. No one notices unless I really point it out. Theres also not much I can do about it.I was at the bathhouse a couple weekends ago (and mind you everyone there is naked so were all pretty past self-consciousness) but I was sitting in a hot tub and suddenly I realize three other strangers in my general vicinity all have Invisalign. So we had a fun little naked group conversation about it. Ha! But I only noticed because I have it myself. Its really nothing to feel self conscious about and its more common than you think.It depends on the treatment plan but I regret Invisalign because it\\'s incompatible with my client-facing, talking job. I have thick elastics that snap off when I open my mouth to laugh, cough, or pronounce some words. The elastics snap out of my mouth and I can\\'t control where they land. This means they can end up on a conference table or on a colleague\\'s face. \\n\\nAnd the first few days of a new tray, my words sound slurred, like I\\'m drunk. The trays cut inside of my lips. So, I must apply wax to my gum line to prevent bleeding, which doesn\\'t help the slurring.\\n\\nMy experience doesn\\'t seem to be common. But I talk nearly 6 hours a day for work. I wouldn\\'t recommend Invisalign if you\\'re in a similar position.I would say that only the elastics are noticeable but you can remove them when you have an important eventIt was very noticeable for about 3 weeks when I got it. It improved with time but....you could see it very clearly, I spoke with quite a lisp, the extra saliva and extra water and sucky tray sounds...its a lot. The extra cleaning of the trays so often and the pain? Day 1, you likely low key wish you didn\\'t just do this. Reality sets in....\\nThe first 3 weeks are fucking hell.  The subsequent 3 weeks suck but you start to get the hang of it. Soon you\\'re thriving. And now you\\'re telling your friends THEY should get invisalign  and how its really not that bad and worth every penny. I got over being self conscious about 3 months in when I was seeing results and knew its short term silly sounding trays, vs the smile I want!I visited my dad for a weekend. Arrived on Friday and we hung out all weekend. On Sunday evening he asked me when I was starting my Invisalign and getting my first retainer! Don\\'t overthink it! If people do notice they\\'ll probably just tell you that they are considering doing it too ‚Im self-conscious when I take them out as the trays fill a gap for me until I can get an implant. With them in, not many people are that close to me to see and it doesnt bother me even if they are.I wore 138 trays over the course of 2 and a half years, and had something like 16 buttons. Not one person noticed that I was wearing trays. edit: actually one person did, and that\\'s because she was wearing Invisaligns too!\\n\\nElastics are a bit of a different story, they\\'re FAR more noticeable.

Im gonna be in tooth jail for a loooong time.btw what do you mean by 3 scans deep, i thought itero scans are only taken at the beginning or before refinements, no?I had my initial scan. The lower teeth werent tracking correctly after ten or so trays, so I had a second scan. Then after another eight trays, they werent tracking again, so I had to get scanned a third time. Now Im on my third œTray 1,\\x9d and I started in May 2021. Hoping this round sticks so I can get to the refinements and eventually, maybe someday far far down the line, nights only.so after each scan do they send off a clincheck and then manfacture the aligners all over again and you have to discard your original set?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso you mentioned you are on your third tray 1 but also mentioned that you had completed 10 or so trays so that was a bit confusing. Oh actually, im guessing the some of the movements done in the first 10 trays were completed but perhaps the alignment was not going to plan coming to the end of the 10 trays hence you had to \"re route\" so to speak..Thats right.

I had my last cleaning with my usual dentist in February and I have my next cleaning scheduled with her in August.\\n\\nThe dentist that I am getting the Invisalign from says that they recommend a cleaning on the day I get my buttons glued on/Invisalign trays delivered even though my last cleaning was 3 and a half months ago. My dental hygiene is pretty good, I brush, floss, waterpik, and mouthwash daily, my teeth and x-rays were all fine at my cleaning and exam in February. \\n\\nShould I pay $250 for another cleaning next week when I get the Invisalign? Or do you think it's fine to opt-out and just go for my regularly scheduled cleaning in August? Also, anyone who chose not get a cleaning the day of, did your buttons ever fall off?\\n\\nThanks in advance!Its up to you. They clean the area of the tooth that gets attachments so it glues, but its not like a hygiene cleaning.Ah, okay this makes sense. I never thought about the fact that they clean the spot. My dentist kind of implies that if I don't get the cleaning the buttons will fall off, and if I get the cleaning she will re-attach any button that may fall off for free, but if I don't take the cleaning, she will charge $100 for re-attachments.\\n\\nI feel better about not letting her do the cleaning.Its a good idea to get cleanings a little more often when on Invisalign. Doesnt really matter if you get them before or after startingThis might be a dumb question, but why is it a good idea to do get cleanings more frequently while on Invisalign? Considering they are removable and I would do my usual hygiene routine while wearing them? Or is it more about effectively cleaning around the buttons?\\n\\nAlso, how often would you recommend? Ever 3 months instead of 6?I have been doing 3-4 cleanings a year with Invisalign. There is a greater chance of cavities with Invisalign and I want to make sure I catch any problems early.Oh okay, thanks for the input!Nah. I didn't get mine cleaned the same day and I'm doing fine!I never had a cleaning done before. Honestly, I'd never had a cleaning done before period. At my monthly check-ups, my orthodontist would scale my teeth where tartar had built up. I think your routine sounds great in terms of taking all the measures to protect your teeth during treatment.  I've had many attachments- 6 on the first day, and then like 20 for trays 20-27 :-( Once or twice they fell off and I just left it until my next appointment to mention it to her, and she re-applied them (for free) in like 2 minutes. $100 dollars seems crazy expensive to have them re-applied! That being said, I lost no more than 2 over the course of my treatment, so paying $100 to have those replaced would still have been cheaper than paying for a cleaning.Yeah, $100 seems a little crazy to me but I think it's a tactic to strongarm patients into getting the $250 cleaning from her. I think I'll take my chances without it and just pay the $100 if needed.\\n\\nYou said left your attachments off until the next visit, did that affect the movement of your teeth? Having some attachments missing for a while?She was pretty nonchalant when I showed up with one of them having fallen off and didnt, you know, urge me to book an emergency appointment if it happened again. Id have no idea how/if it affected the movement. Im guessing over the long term, yes. But I think over the course of a week or two, probably not much. Maybe not at all. Anyway, I havent lost any since the first month or two. I think that now that my teeth are more aligned, my bite is better so Im not, like, scraping one on the top off with my bottom tooth or something ·\\x8f»\\x8dï¸\\x8fMine didn't align with any cleanings, and nobody said anything about it.

But after multiple days it would start to smell a bit off and have minor buildup. I started using Retainer Brite tablets nightly and seems to be doing the trick to keep the Invisalign super clean.\\n\\nWhat are your cleaning routines to keep your Invisalign from getting grimy / smelly?Hi, Im a dental assistant. We recommend not using toothpaste, its abrasive on the plastic. Having said that, if youre changing your trays weekly then it wont have much of a chance to harm them because by the time it does, youll be changing to the next tray. We tell people to wash them with hand soap or dish soap. It will make them stay nice and shiny and clear, and its something you already have in your home- no need to purchase anything special.Good to know on the toothpaste. My previous orthodontist told me to use it. What should I rub them with? A soft bristle toothbrush? I notice the build up in the crevicesYes, you could. Keep them in a bit of water when youre not using them and they shouldnt get much buildup. Make sure you are brushing your teeth after you eat, even if its with a plain toothbrush and no toothpaste. You really want to get all food debris out before you pop them back in.A big thing is not letting saliva dry on your trays. If theyre out, put them into water (with or without cleaning tablets or hydrogen peroxide).This is what I do. Im on 10 day changes and have never needed to do more than a quick brush with toothpaste when Im putting them back in. By the time I change them they look a little cloudy but they arent noticeably discoloured and they certainly dont smell.there are a lot of mixed views on using toothpaste to clean your aligners and that is because a lot of toothpastes are abrasive and leave micro-scratches in your aligners. these tiny scratches can harbor bacteria and might be causing the smell. im sure some toothpastes are worse than others, but just a thought!I buy cheap supermarket brand denture tablets and soak them while I eat my dinner. Then I use a childrens toothbrush and water to ensure any debris is removed. Done this for a year with no issues and they never smell.Morning and evening I soak them in 50/50 water and hydrogen peroxide mixture then brush with toothbrush. They have never discolored or smelled at all, even the ones I had to wear for almost 2 months waiting for refinements.I use retainer brite everyday and use the same water throughout the day, then rinse it with water, clean at least once with toothbrush using soap or low abrasive toothpaste.I usually do a cleaning tablet in the morning and brush them with dish soap at night. During meals (unless Im out), keep them in water. This has kept them clear and smell free. Im prone to buildup and I found just cleaning them at night left them a bit grimey.I use half a retainer brite tablet twice daily. When I eat breakfast, I leave them in water. When I eat lunch and dinner, i put half a tablet in with the water. I know this next bit is controversial but my ortho told me it was fine- I also use a super soft bristled toothbrush  when I rinse them, and thats helped me a TON with the grimey buildup.I have been using my toothbrush with toothpaste but I'm considering getting a kids toothbrush and using soap going forward. It's also hard for me to get into the gap for the incisors on the bottom with my toothbrush. \\n\\nI use efferent 3 minute antibacterial every couple of days - I'm on weekly changes.I take them out 3 times a day, and put them in water with a cheap retainer/dentures tablet. At dinner though, I will put them in an ultrasonic cleaner with a tablet. It really helps getting anything stuck out without scratching them.I just use a soft toothbrush and water about 3 times per day.I use retainer brite tablets and in the morning while I brush I put half a tablet in an ultrasonic cleaner and run it. Then at night, when I eat dinner, I do the same thing using the other half of the tablet. Could be over board but all my retainers still look brand new when Im done with them and theyre odor free.I use a Breelex Retainer Cleaner tablet in an ultra sonic cleaner twice a day... when I get up each morning and while I eat dinner.  When I take them out of the cleaner I brush them with a extra-soft tooth brush and rinse well.  \\n\\nThe Breelex seems to tackle stains better than Retainerbrite.  \\n\\nThis process keeps my aligners crystal clear for the entirety of 2 weeks I have to wear them.I only brush it clean with a toothbrush and water. And just keep my teeth cleanI use retainer bright in the morning and at night. During the day I rinse with water and brush lightly after meals. Seems to be working out well and I am a happy camper.I use toothpaste in the morning and before I go to bed.\\nI change mine once a week, so I'm not concerned about abrasiveness.

I'm still learning the terms so mixed up the two.

I am 95% done and going to do 1 more refinement and Ill be finished! Its worth it just make sure your dentist is a perfectionist!

Your dentist matters so do not settle just because the price seems reasonable etc!Here are before/after pics of a scan by an Orthodontist. She says Invisalign will fix my teeth (overjet + slight cross bite) in about 2y. However, i met another Ortho for a second opinion and she says the better option for me would be permanent retainers. I'm confused which option to go with :(Im very confused by the 2nd consultation. Permanent retainers arent going to move your teeth. Is that ortho suggesting no treatment for some reason?My bad, i meant Traditional braces, I'm still learning the terms sorry. She said the traditional ones could work better for me.

Dont know why Ive received down votes.Hi!! I just finished Invisalign after an overjet. I had braces in high school, so my teeth looked almost perfect still, I could just tell they were slowly moving forward. I had 3 different quotes (2 from different dentists and 1 from an orthodontist). I ended up choosing the orthodontist - the treatment time was longer but they specialize in teeth movement so I felt more comfortable with a specialist. I had to have rubber bands for a while to bring my teeth back, but they didnt bother me and I was really good about wearing them. My total treatment time was about 2 years and I am so happy with my results!!Retainers dont move teeth” they help retain their position.

Ill probably do it again.Im on weekly changes soon so I could maybe stomach that, will try and behave for as long as possible tho hahaIm on weekly changes, too. I just get iced drinks and use a straw which Im sure helps.I drank beer with mine in but got 8 cavities after 6 months of them in, despite religiously brushing and swishing. Everyones teeth are different, but I think its better to take them out to drink anything sugary (including alcohol) and brush as soon as you can after.Damn thats awful sorry to hear it :( \\n\\nThanks for the warning. Perhaps I will only do this during special occasionsOoof this is a little scary lol. I dont drink often but when I do, I have cheated by keeping them in. Maybe Ill be a little more mindfulI swish water occasionally and brush my teeth once Im done ! I always say its no different than someone eating candy and brushing their teeth at end of dayWell the stuff being pressed against teeth and lack of saliva is a bit concerning, but if youre not taking them out to drink I struggle to see how anything would get anywhere some water swishing or saliva cant tooI totally understand that. I started off really paranoid bjt just try to swish water occasionally and scrub everything down once I am done[deleted]Id hope its better than nothing for the mean timeI drank a lot of wine with my trays in this weekend haha! Just make sure you swish sone water around too! And brush soon(ish haha)Nice! I feel like a right weirdo with a beer and a water hahaI will drink things that arent likely to leave heavy stains (so I remove them for red wine and coffee), but I definitely will drink green tea iced tea, carbonated water, white wine If I liked beer I would not hesitate to drink beer with them in.\\n\\nAlso, not everyone is equally prone to cavities. I see this as a big concern on this sub, but it isnt the same for everyone. Im one of those people who has to try super hard to get a cavity. Other people get them quite easily. Im sure you know which category you fall into and can conduct yourself accordingly.Yeah people kinda giving me the impression as long as youre not chugging sugary things and actually being mindful and cleaning properly etc you can get away with it. \\n\\nI have a couple fillings from wear / chipping but theyre not from cavities (not the same thing right?) and ortho said I have strong teeth (which I can believe because I did use to be more lax about itThese comments are absolutely crazy lol. I dont know what orthodontists yall go to but mines made it clear that I can drink only PURE WATERexactly!!Yes, I drink with them in all the time. Beer is fineSweet thanks! How far through are you?Halfway through my initial 20 trays, I do 10 day changes and just leave my aligners soaking in water whenever I have them out and they never get dirtyHate the feeling of anything but water but I do it lolI honestly drink anything with mine. Iced coffee, cocktails of all colors, tea etc. But I also have to change my liners weekly so by the time I have to change them they are barley stained.Nice yeah Im on weekly changes after this one so the staining doesnt really concern me, just cavitiesI havent gotten any! I brush 2-3 times a day. I think it also depends on how prone you are to cavities. Ive never had one before. Also have had no signs of any and on my last week!I am on tray 14 and regularly drink whatever I want and have since the moment I left the office on that first day. I regularly drink beer (I gravitate towards darker beers), Monsters, occasional Cokes, and literally whatever else I want. I swish with water about 75% of the time afterwards but not always. Ive gotten some light staining on a set or two that I noticed with them out but nothing that anyone would notice while they are in my mouth. I typically soak them in peroxide for 20 or so minutes most mornings while I shower and that seems to keep them fine.Monsters and cokes wow. Im too paranoid for that but gl. Soaking that often is probably smart then. I dont plan on doing it so much but ofc if its warranted then I probably willIn the beginning I took out the trays every time I drank something besides water. Then I realised it barely gave any stains on my teeth or the trays and it was to much of an issue so I just let it go! Just properly brush your trays & teeth and youll be good! Good luck on your journey!(On tray 54 out of 59 changing one per week)Thanks! Damn thats long but youre nearly there! Do you think youll be done for good or need refinements?I drink everything that is clear so it doesn't leave stains. However, I'm often stuck witch trays that taste like gin for a few days after drinking. Even though I clean and soak them after...Nice thanks! Haha could be a lot worse. Wouldnt mind that too much personally. \\n\\nAlways seem to get residual taste on stuff, same with the cleaning tablets but that goes away fast thankfully because they do not taste as nice as gin! (Yes I rinse them well but cant seem to shake it)Lemsip stained mine really badly when I was on invisalign so I'd avoid that.Thanks that is kinda niche so unlikely to hear if asking, but I imagine there seem to be a few random things that are awful staining wise. \\n\\nSorry you had to have that, thanks for saving me from itI drink coffee and tea with a reusable metal straw that has a curved rubber tip. I try to keep if off the teeth.Might have to invest in one of themI try to stick to clear drinks if I have my aligners in. If Im in the go and drink coffee or something sugary, I just make sure to rinse with water.I drink anything with them in, coffee, beer etc. I do try to swish with water afterwards and when Im at home use mouthwash or brush my teeth. As long as you have good hygiene I think you should be fineI read all these comments here even though my orthodontics said I should drink only pure water. It is hard to hang out with friends and avoid drinking. I keep them in and drink beer, so I wear them as much as possible and then brush when it is possible. I should wear mine for at least 22-24 hours. It is hard with all the food and afterward brushing to have them for the recommended time. I hope I will not have any cavities since I don't have any.Exactly. Think Im pretty close to this mindset :)hope you like gin and tonic lolYes almost at the finish line ;) As Ive understood it Im done after the last tray, I have had rubber bands for 22 hours a day, and now for the last weeks I have left I only need to wear them when I sleep which is a big relief!Awesome congrats! Thats super exciting for you. I feel like Ive noticed progress already and also got bands 22h a day. So Im being optimistic Ill be 23 trays and done and no issues haha. Maybe a few refinements I could acceptThank you! Just hang in there and keep up the good work and the weeks will fly by!Thanks! Im not too worried. Already doing enough to keep myself sane I think. I just have my snacks before/after dinner and have different dinners to accommodate.\\n\\nProbably eat more now honestly ‚ Still getting some coffees in and acclimatised to not having 5+ a day which is fine …To my understanding anything that is not water is slightly acidic. Anything acidic is bad for your teeth and erode enamel. Sugar in particular is just something bacteria loves to eat (and poop acid afterwards). Saliva is supposed to help, but since you're trapping teeth (and your beverage) behind trays, saliva cant get in to do its job to restore enamel and wash away acid. How bad that is depends on your genetics and acidity of the thing you're drinking.  \\n\\n\\nWhen putting this into perspective, its hard not to follow advice - DRINK ONLY WATER. That being said, my ortho allowed beverages like tea with trays out if i rinse afterwards. Also once in a blue moon I do break the rules and drink a beer with trays on. My teethies hurt badly if trays are out :(Ah ok. Interesting about bacteria and sugar for acid context. Im pretty much planning on just doing it with them in when its a pretty rare social but I will fairly constantly swill with water same time. I struggle to see how if you say drink a beer with a straw, then deliberately swill all over. How beer would get under trays but water wouldnt. \\n\\nMy ortho said itd be ok to occasionally have trays out a fair few hours but Im reluctant to do that too. Might try and use a careful balance when necessaryI miss sipping drinks. My go to strategy recently is to get drunk quickly, brush teeth and then sip water \\n\\nMy ortho too said its ok to have lazy day but that i have to shift tray schedule by a day. In practical reality if my trays are out for more than 40 mins, teethies start to hurt. So I never had a lazy day in my 15/63 trays so far. Thats quite practical because the general recommendation is not to have them out for longer anyway.Yeah might have to do something like that. Not really a lightweight so might do a combo of drinking with them in, taking out briefly and going hard lol. \\n\\nWould be fun trying to get them back in before it hits you haha. Ive had 1 day of having them out a bit over an hour which was fine, but Im reluctant to do so even if they dont hurt (but yeah if they do, get those bad boys back in)I drink tea with milk and white wine quite regularly with my aligners in. I save red wine for change day lol.Yeah Im in that mindset with curries but tbf havent had staining yet and Ill be on 1 week changes so that part doesnt really both meI change trays biweekly. First week I am more careful, maybe drink beers and rinse with water. On my second week I don't mind that much, I had bloody maries, white wine etc. Still avoid milkshakes e.g.Interesting. Yeah I think Ill experiment along those lines. My trays are weekly after this one so Im not overly concerned about staining but still intend to avoid sugar and coffee for obvious reasonsI avoid anything hot and try to avoid sugars as much as possible. But when I go out, I end up drinking cocktails and beers, that have more sugar than anything xD \\n\\nTry your best, but don't stop living your life for some invisalign codex.\\n\\nIn my case, I am midway through without cavities or staining of trays.I drink everything and anything with Invisalign.. Teas, coffee, lattes, bubble tea. No issues. I just use a soft brush and toothpaste to scrub down the trays at night then let them soak in polident for a few mins. I almost always get 22hours in by doing this. \\nWeekly changes.Damn thats interesting. How about eating and brushing etc during the day? \\n\\nTaking mine out 2 or 3 times a day, enjoying my food calmly and maybe having a coffee then going straight into cleaning teeth I struggle to hit a solid 22 as is. \\n\\n21.5 seems chill and I can live my life without stressing over it21.5 Hours + your sanity is way worth it haha.\\n\\nI eat small portions just as I did before Invisalign (4-6 times/day). I get full very easily and I don't like pushing myself to eat only 2-3 big meals / day.\\n\\nAt the beginning, I really tried to brush 2-3 times a day but that got old quickly. Now I rarely brush throughout the day.. I try and make an effort If I eat something staining like spaghetti.\\n\\nWhat I do is floss after every meal. Making sure that the trays I pop in after getting in as snug as possible if that makes sense. Then once a day (always when I take my shower at night) I chew on my chewie for a few mins). \\n\\nNo issues with tracking and was just at the dentist for general cleaning and no cavities.Wow maybe its not too bad for getting cavities then. I think Im still gonna brush after every meal. Flossing takes me ages so Im doing it once or twice a day. I tend to eat more at meal times even though I only really ate 3 times a day with a little snacking before handI drink coffee but Im on weekly changes so by the time the stains are noticeable its time for a new tray. I also dont put sugar in my coffee. I drink beer and fizzy water as well. Im not prone to cavities so I swish with water and then brush really well when I take the trays out.Awesome :) I love coffee but might pass on it with trays as I can still get 3 a day which seems ok and maybe a healthy change. \\n\\nI also have mochas/put syrups in normal ones so its a bit more sugary and think Ill pass on having with trays as it seems a bit too risky for meYeah agree, I skip anything with sugar (except for beer ‚)I drank all kinds of stuff with them in all the time. Been a little over a year and I just got my retainer. Not been a problem. Its only about keeping your teeth cleaner, thats it. But I was wearing my trays only 10 days each so it wasnt enough for any staining/discoloration to take place.I only don't drink tea or coffee with them unless I'm a few days from swapping.Yes, currently drinking some hard seltzers with them in. Just make sure you brush over your trays with some mouthwash or toothpaste after and youll be fine.Beer is fine aslong as you when you finished drinking you immedeatly brush your teeth and clean the alignersI do it all the time. Coffee, iced coffee, red wine, beers, etc. I just drink water a lot in between and brush as soon as I can.Unless its water or pure alcohol like vodka then its not recommended.. I guess vodka isnt recommended but its safe. U can drink anything u want with Invisalign in, u just have to take them out and rinse ur teeth and the trey itself.

Your smile does look wider and deep bite is improved so my layperson guess is they are focusing on that first?Heeeey, thank you for ur comment! I changed orthos , still at the same clinic however this dentist is now handling my refinements. Now that youve mentioned it my smile does look wider but the changes that I want to see just arent there. I think thats what they said before that they were moving the teeth in the back first.Yeah there's definite widening of the palate which is a biggie, but I too would be pretty upset with the alignment progress. It may be worth getting a consult from an orthodontist since this is their speciality. OP, if you choose to change from a dentist, you can sometimes pick up where you are with an ortho.Thank you because i literally dont see any major changes.

Because my crowding was so minimal only one tooth was slightly back which is my biggest concern so to have Invisalign for 8 months and the bottoms arent straight is a big concern for me. \\n\\n54 trays is a lot but as you said, it makes more sense and also allows less time for refinements. \\n\\nIll mention the bite ramps as I had them on my initial treatment but dont currently have them on my refinement trays.Im not an ortho so I cant judge your bite or alignment.  But is this what your clincheck also looks like? \\n\\nI know for my bottom teeth, the clincheck doesnt look like it changed much from the front, but from the back and the arch its actually a lot straighter at the end of 54 trays.  \\n\\nDo talk to your ortho, since it could be your bite and alignment is actually ok now? How our teeth look is also affected by size of the teeth and gum line so it may not be fixed by Invisalign alone.  I know for me my upper teeth are much bigger than my bottom teeth so, I will always look a little like I have rabbit teeth just due to the size.Your smile looks wider and I see more of your bottom teeth than before! But I agree overall it doesnt LOOK drastically different. Hopefully more results will come soon. Your teeth seem pretty straight though so I dont know what else they could do betterTray 5 is early still.Yeah for sure.

I wasnt on it for very long. In the middle of the week of my second tray, my top right gum on tooth 4 became insanely swollen, my mouth was throbbing, pain down my neck etc. the tooth turned gray. nightmare. We filed my trays down and it helped for about a week. I got X-rays done and was told I have cervical resorption and will need my tooth removed. My dentist and specialist say that it takes years to develop and Invisalign could never cause it, but all of my research says its strictly dental trauma that causes it and Invisalign is considered that. \\n\\nHas this happened to anyone else? Are my dentists avoiding Invisalign causing this? Im terrified possibly needing my tooth removed and I would really like to know if this was the reason to understand more for my own sanityNot a dentist or orthodontist, but my general understanding is that orthodontic work (including Invisalign) may exacerbate underlying dental trauma but is generally not severe enough to cause some of these issues by itself. Youre right that Invisalign and orthodontic work generally is a mild form of dental trauma, but thats the key word - mild. However if the tooth is already weakened (especially if you, say, had some sort of blow to that area of the mouth/that tooth) Invisalign may be the straw that broke the camels back. If youre looking for an expert opinion feel free to ask a professional, but there arent too many dental professionals on this sub, so you may not get much expert guidance here.I have a second opinion this morning. I havent had any trauma to the mouth or head and take great care of my mouth. My concern is that my dentist/specialist dont want to blame Invisalign for maybe legalities? I have no idea. But I have not had anything happen that couldve caused it that Im aware of. Im hoping my second opinion this morning will give me more clarity. Was just looking to see if anyone else experienced this and found answers.I dont know what to tell you but just want to say Im so, soooo sorry this has happened to you. I cant imagine your disappointment and stress from this. ’”’”\\n\\nInvisalign is supposed to be gentler on the roots than braces (one of my top reasons for going with Invisalign). \\n\\nHowever, if you had short roots, moving the teeth is definitely *not* recommended. I would suspect you had short roots before starting treatment, and your Ortho or dentist should have recognized this before treatment started. ” \\n\\nI pray it all works out for you with the least stress possible. \\x8f\\x8f»I dont think I had short roots, I definitely had to go through a decent process to make sure I was a candidate. Im so sad about it. Im 25F and its really close to the front of my face. Apparently its the rarest form of resorption and it can lead to myocarditis or meningitis? So awful. I was so excited about Invisalign \\x81 I appreciate your kind words so much.’”\\xad I hate this so much for you. Im guessing the myocarditis or meningitis risk is due to infection risk? Perhaps swishing daily with an anti-microbial, such as a few drops of nascent iodine, hydrogen peroxide or grapefruit seed extract would help curb that (or using these in a WaterPik). \\n\\nI will be praying the best possible outcome for you. \\x8f\\x8f»\\x9dï¸\\x8fHow does the dentist know the patient has short roots? X-ray?Yes, they can tell a person has short roots with x-rays. They also make you fill out a health questionnaire and ask what medications youre on etc., as certain medications can cause bone decay. They also make sure youve been cleared with your dentist. \\n\\nWhat happened to the OP is extremely rare. I feel so bad. ”I cant advise but sending you a huge hug —Thank you §¡Im not an ortho so I cant help you with answering your questions.  \\n\\nhttps://www.aae.org/specialty/communique/differentiating-resorption/\\n\\nThis is a good article that talks about the different types of resorptions.   \\n\\nCervical resorption, Im assuming you have external cervical resorption, according to the article is the most commonly seen type and etiology is often idiopathic (dont know exactly why it happened).  \\nOrthodontic history can be a predisposing factor but it doesnt seems like its the sole cause.  It means if you do orthodontic treatment, you have increased risk.  If you happen to have other dont know what predisposing factors (even the doctor may not know) you can develop this. \\n\\nOrthodontic practice causes pressure resorption according to the article.  \\n\\nSo I guess cervical resorption is multifactorial and the exact etiology is unclear at the moment.  So its really just bad luck.  \\n\\nI was told by my ortho before we started that doing orthodontic treatment can cause resorption, my teeth can turn grey, but he also said it was rare.  Also I was told that if I do happen to have this complication, they can treat it (as in implant teeth or other ways to make it look nicer)\\n\\nSo it really sucks that you werent well informed before you started.  Now what has happened has happened, the more important thing is what can they do for you now.  What options are they giving you?I was never told any of this information and am just in shock. My only options that Im being told so far are to have the tooth extracted and get an implant. I have a second opinion this morning :/I think thats the only option now, since the tooth has died.  It was also what I was told as well, not much you can do after the root dies. \\n\\nSo unfortunate that you had to go through this.  Im also shocked that you werent informed of the risks.  Hope your second opinion goes well or at least the solution given to you gives you some comfort.This happened to me but they dont know for sure it was the result of Invisalign or other dental trauma. In my case, I had mild resorption for years (not noticed until 5years after I was done with Invisalign) that picked up some time during the pandemic - when I wasnt going to the dentist, got pregt and was incredibly stressed out like everyone else. So could be from ortho or not, we really dont know.  I had to have the tooth extracted and am going through the implant process now. It sucks, but I figure it is better than the tooth falling out at random?Im sorry you experienced this too. How has the process been? Im really nervous.Fine, just expensive and prolonged. I probably wont get the new crown until early next year- went for the most conservative option in hopes of the highest chance of a successful implant. Im 37 so I hope this thing will be with me the rest of my life, didnt want to take any unnecessary chances.You had this before you started Invisalign. You weren't in Invisalign long enough for something like this to manifest. Just bad luck/timing.

I have an eating disorder, usually characterised by throwing up after meals. I had it mostly under control before I started invisalign and Ive been lucky that except for a little wear to two teeth, it hadnt done any serious damage.\\n\\nHowever! Invisalign has caused a bit of a relapse. Im more prone to binge eating now because I know I cant eat more than a couple of times a day, and as a result Ive started throwing up more often because I feel too full after meals. Im also worried its worse for my teeth because I now have to brush them to put my trays back in, whereas before I was very careful to just rinse my mouth out with warm water (advice is to not brush straight after throwing up). \\n\\nHas anyone else had this problem? I dont want to quit treatment, Im on tray 10 of 15 so not long left, and the waiting list for mental health services in my country means itll be months before I see someone anyway. Any tips for getting to the end of treatment would be great!I think you can try talking to your dentist about it.  They may be able to prescribe you some high fluoride mouthwash which you can use after your purge.  Then you dont need to brush right away.  You should floss though to get rid of food particles.  They can probably give you advice on how to keep your teeth from becoming damaged from the acid and maybe will change how they assess your teeth as well. \\n\\nAs for your condition it really is hard to cope.  Maybe you can try eating normally like before Invisalign and just reduce the number of hours of wear.  You then need to extend the number of days before you change trays, but in the long run its better for your health that way.  \\n\\nSo I think talking to your dentist about it first?You're right, I should probably ask them for advice. I'm just worried they'll tell me not to continue treatment, which I really don't want - I can see a big difference to my teeth already and I don't want to go backwards!I think since you spent the money and already in the process, it doesnt make sense to stop treatment either.  I also hope your dentist understands your desire to continue treatment.  \\n\\nThey say to hit at least 20 hours per day, but thats ideal so the treatment can be finished on time.  But even if you dont hit enough hours, it just means you stay in the same trays longer and the treatment time becomes longer.  In the long run youll still be able to finish treatment.  So your dentist can adjust the treatment based on how many hours realistically you can hit while maintaining a good meal time schedule to cope with your eating disorder.  \\n\\nHope it goes well for you~You can eat more than a few times a day. I have issues eating enough in general and Ive broken it out to 6 small meals, I just dont spend a long time eating them. So taking my trays out 6x a day for 20 min is still 2 hrs a day.I suppose it's laziness, I'm avoiding having to floss and brush several times a day as opposed to two! But I should prioritise what works rather than what is easiest.You dont always have to do that either, personally Ive only been brushing and flossing 2x a day and just swishing water otherwise and havent had any issues at all. My ortho was a bit looser on those rules tho since I had braces before and understand the whole ordeal lol. Just dont deprive yourself from eating and make yourself sick, thats far worse!If you do throw up, use a baking soda mouth wash to neutralize the stomach acids so you dont brush these acids into your teeth. I had that problem but with acidic juice drinks and my teeth got sensitive, the dentist told me about mixing a tsp of baking soda with 8 oz of water to rinse. But I would agree with other comments about  breaking your eating breaks into smaller meals to feel like normal, sometimes I push the limit of leaving trays out to 3 hours and I still stay of track according to my ortho.Okay this may explain why my teeth have been so sensitive. The dentist was baffled as I was really struggling with even just water and air touching them when he was trying to work. I thought it was just normal, some people are more sensitive than others.It took me a while for the sensitivity to go away, regular toothpaste made the sensitivity go crazy for me I could barely brush this certain tooth. I use sensodyme tooth enamel repair toothpaste and that has helped a lot, you can find it in most stores in US.Eat whenever you want. Rinse your mouth water and pop back in. Brush when you get the chance. No reason to go backwards over Invisalign your teeth will do great. No stress!I might have to brush less and just rinse, to stop myself avoiding taking them out. I know it's silly but I've been trying to keep them in as long as possible because the results are great so far!I haven't got any advice to offer but I'm sorry to hear you're struggling, I really wish Invisalign/dentists would warn their patients about how triggering a process this can be.\", 'labels': ['mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'self-consciousness', 'facial appearance', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'tray time management', 'oral hygiene', 'financial concerns'], 'scores': [0.2414189577102661, 0.1988246738910675, 0.11962530761957169, 0.11813532561063766, 0.11565860360860825, 0.11025914549827576, 0.09607796370983124]}, {'sequence': 'Day 4 of Invisalignhello everyone, i just started with invisalign and i just wanted to post the only perks ive found while im suffering lol and see if anyone had any to add so i can maybe see the bright side \\xad\\xad\\n\\n-no tooth sensitivity\\n\\n-cant eat when im bored\\n\\n-pretty much physically impossible to bite my nails (been a nail biter since i was little)\\n\\n-cant pick my lips either!\\n\\nanyone have any to add?Don\\'t have to brush your teeth before bed, because you already did it right after dinner!Honestly a perk my girlfriend hates.

I\\'m hoping things even out. I\\'m only on tray 2 of 42. ¬I have this problem too The reduction in nail/cuticle biting is REAL.The trays(and the retainers) make your smile look picture perfect towards the end.

I can\\'t with the trays in and once my teeth were aligned they no longer snag on my cheeks. No more cankers!All these things I struggled with.. you\\'ll definitely get the hang of it later. Right now your teeth are moving a lot because this is all new to your mouth, but once they\\'re used to the movement, each tray will probablybe shitty for about a day and after that you\\'ll definitely feel more comfortable taking them out quickly to have a snack. \\n\\nThat\\'s how it goes for me at least.. I didn\\'t have snacks the first set of trays and slowly because fed up and just got used to getting them out even if it\\'s only for 10 minutes.

I keep seeing everyone talking about suffering the first couple weeks, until things normalize. But Im not hearing exact details as to the suffering specifics. Would you be willing to share? Im in my 2 week countdown until I get mine, and want to be fully informed.everyone is different obviously, but personally im miserable lol. the gums of my top and lower lips are all cut up. my tongue is also very cut up, all of my teeth are sore, and im overall just extremely sore and uncomfortable atm. ik this will pass as im very early in my treatment but i wouldnt get yours hopes up for smooth sailing dvdvsvsvOw, Im sorry. That sounds painful. I hope it gets better for you soon. Thank you for explaining that a little more.Im on tray 5 of 33 (two week changes) and I honestly dont know what people are talking about with this. My teeth are sore for about 15 minutes after I put in my new trays but they quickly feel normal. This happens again at each meal time, with the soreness getting shorter each time. Im three days into tray 5 and my teeth are only sore for a minute or so after putting my trays back in. \\n\\nGood luck on your journey!This makes VERY hopeful! Thank you!Ive been doing Invisalign treatments for a few years now on & off. With every new refinement my teeth are incredibly sore with the first 1-3 trays. Its just your teeth adjusting to moving in a way that they havent / arent used to. I think there is obviously going to be a little soreness with each new tray, but nothing too bad at all.Would you say its something that Ibuprofen and a soft foods diet would get you through on those days?I never had to take ibuprofen & I would say my teeth are moving fairly significantly.. Soft foods definitely help though. I would say an ibuprofen forsure would handle any pain experienced. I wouldnt be too worried about it :)Some people say avoid anti inflamation drugs, as they can delay progressI wonder why that would beApparently, when you are moving the teeth, it causes some sort of inflamation and that it\\'s supposed to help the teeth move? I\\'m not sure, I\\'ve just read it on a bunch of forums/blogsI\\'m on tray 3/14, changing every 10 days. One of the things I was least expecting was the severity of lip soreness, especially the inner top lip. The rubbing on the retainer was pretty intense and I specifically took acetaminophen to help with it. I thought about applying something topical but never did. I also cut my cheek the first day putting in the upper retainer, so that definitely didn\\'t help. Otherwise my experience has been similar to others, some overall mouth soreness the day I change retainers. It does hurt to eat though most days, so I have to be cautious of the crispity crunchy factor of my food at all times sadly. Le sigh.Because \\n\\n1. You are not used to it\\n \\n2. Your teeth have never moved before, so its a new experience for them, its up to your ortho to plan how many teeth move, many at a time means much more soreness.\\n\\n3. Your lip will be pretty dry because they are some foreign matters in your mouth. And they going to be a load of saliva forming cuz of that.\\n\\n4. removing and inserting hurt like hell.\\n\\n5. Some tray can cut your tongue, you need to file it.\\n\\n6. Eating on the very first day is hurt; your teeth are nimble.So for my first tray, I was miserable the first day. I have high pain tolerance, and I wanted to rip my teeth out. It doesn\\'t help that my dentist told me not to use ibuprofen, and ibuprofen is the only pain reliever that really works for me. It was so bad I was immediately considering quitting, even though I literally just spent thoudands. It\\'s hard to explain the exact suffering... it feels kind of like your teeth are all slowly being extracted at once.\\n\\nDay 2, slightly better but I couldn\\'t stop messing with the trays. By day 3 or 4 I felt a lot better, got used to it. I\\'m on tray 3 now, and nothing has felt anywhere near what that 1st day felt like, even with tray changes. I think your teeth get used to moving pretty quickly. \\n\\nSome people on here say they \"don\\'t even notice\" anymore, but I always know. I have pretty bad dry mouth and my TMJ has actually gotten worse. It\\'s bearable and most days are fine, I\\'m just really looking forward to being done already.\\n\\nMy fiance will see me eating and be like \"gasp! Did you remember to take your trays out???\" And I just have to laugh. Like I would ever forget they were in while eating ‚‚‚ He just doesn\\'t know what it\\'s like to have a foreign object in your mouth at all times.For me it was just miserable because it\\'s a lot of work to get used to. I was also caught by surprise with attachments, so felt super self concious about that. I didn\\'t have any pain from tooth movements or trays digging in or anything like thatOoooo that last one sounds like a no thanksThe remover tool helped so much with the removalI just got my 1st tray last week. The suffering was worst like day1-3. Day 2 was miserable and I completely regretted every penny. My lips hurt from rubbing/getting caught in the trays. I have hooks for rubberbands that are very pokey. It was taking forever to get them out and then a full 5 minutes of dental care before I put them back in. My teeth hurt especially in the front. Eating was weird, stuff getting caught on attachments. Speaking was frustrating. Finding ways to distract yourself is key. I\\'m on day 6 now and it\\'s gradually getting less annoying. Like wearing clothing that\\'stoo tight. Still annoying if you think about it, but you don\\'t notice it if you are focused on something.Ok I might consider invisalign just to stop eating my nails\"I just put my new trays in, too tight I can\\'t talk\" an excuse not to pick up unwanted calls. Kinda true, kinda convenientI am constantly dehydrated (which leads to migraines) so being forced to drink water all the time has been great. Unfortunately Ive been getting awful migraines from the jaw pain and teeth movement \\xad\\xad Im only on day 4 but its been nonstop painMy gums used to bleed when flossing, now they are used to it ‚Cant wait to get Invisaligns  all these good benefits lolDoes anyone else feel like a flossing ninja?  I thought I was pretty fast before but now boom!  flossed in a matter of seconds.Flossing is pretty difficult for me now, thanks to my 22 attachments. In most gaps the floss pops in easily enough but the attachments block it from popping out. I have to let go with one hand and slide the floss out. But I have to go slowly so I dont get floss burn on my gums.No one has noticed it yet!

Is this the typical price for the treatment? This is after insurance too. It would be $12,000 USD without insurance. Am I being scammed?I\\'m in the SF Bay Area and I paid $5,500 out of pocket with no insurance, so to have a bill like that even after insurance sounds completely insane to me. Definitely shop around for other quotes!Thanks for the input! Yes I will be definitely pricing around other orthos. This one was the closest one to me so I chose out of convenience.Im in a high cost of living area too and my Invisalign cost $6k. Insurance covered half, so my out of pocket is $3k. $12k is far more than Ive heard others paying. Definitely get consults from other orthos.I recommend checking out the provider directory on the Invisalign website. They show a provider ranking based on how many Invisalign cases they have completed. \\n\\nAgreed with other posters, this sounds very expensive to me. I think the $5000ish range is typical (and thats without insurance).[deleted]Thanks for the input!Are your teeth a difficult case? Like crooked teeth. Bad arch, overjet, any extractions needed?, any specifics like expander etc? Did they give you the treatment plan?Nope just a typical crossbite fix.. my teeth are pretty straight, nothing too crazy. The Ortho said it will be around 30 trays and they\\'ll adjust if neededYeah thats fucked up. Go anywhere else. Lol. Expect about 3 pr 4 apps at the start that are fairly close together, then expect to see them every 6 to 8 weeks. So find a place that\\'s hours work for your life, that\\'s under $8k (should be easy to find that), and ask the receptionist if their orthodontist tends to run on time or not and if they say that they typically run on time or that they\\'re always on time for their visits ask them to send that to you in writing that they\\'re mostly on time. I only say this because if they\\'re not, they won\\'t put it in writing. I have put in writing for my office \" we are mostly on time at this office ebut emergencies can occur that could delay appointment starts. This is not common and while it happens, it\\'s usually not beyond 10 minutes past your booking time.\" And that\\'s true for me. I had 1 patient in all of April be more than 10 minutes behind their start time and that\\'s cuz the kid before them threw up in the chair and we needed to clean it more than usual.You should also factor in how long they predicted it will take. The Invisalign is only part of the cost : the other component is the orthodontists time.My comprehensive Invisalign to fix my crossbite/crowding was $6000 (Canadian, so $4720 USD) without insurance. 26 initial trays, and 23 refinement trays (49 total).\\n\\nSeems excessive to me.\\n\\nMine also includes 4 retainers at the end.My quote was $4300 without insurance if I paid up front. They didnt say how many trays but I had some spacing and crossbite issues.yeah you are being scammed go to a different ortho. mine was 4K with a platinum provider. there is no reason it should be anywhere past 5.5KDefinitely get more than 1 consult. Everyone\\'s case is going to be different and therefore a different cost, but $12,000 does sound steep to me. But also, my insurance only covered $1500CAD so rates are quite likely a lot different where you are.They were able to check my insurance and low the price by about 200, but still I will definitely take your advice and price around other consults. Thanks for your replyI paid $7K with no insurance so $12K feels like a lotYeah I agree with everyone else. I paid around $5k and Im nearing the end of my second year.12k sounds really high, I paid around 5k with no insuranceWhere are you located? Mine consulted me for $5200 with insurance and Im in nycSan Diego, CA. I\\'m sitting at the Ortho office right now waiting for another quote, but with my parents insurance to see if that brings the price down.Yea your ortho is definitely jacking up the price since insurance is pitching in. Several consults in SoCal has taught me that ~$5,500 is roughly the going rate as of a couple of years ago. So something in the $6k range would be my expectation for a good provider with no input from insurance. If you get other quotes, dont even bring up insurance until you get a plan cost first.$12k is wild. I got 3-4 quotes in Orange County and it all ranged between $5000-6500. One place in Newport was a little higher.Im just outside Los Angeles, California and my treatment cost $3,500 (insurance covered $500). That included an set of 36 trays, unlimited refinements, and correcting my bite. $12,000 seems like they jacked up the price way up to make a big profit even after insurance. My ortho provided a scanning device so my check ins are completely virtual. I know the Los Angeles area may be a bit of a drive but if you want the name just let me know happy to share.How much without insurance7200I am in Escondido, Diamond Invisalign provider and paid $6600 without insurance, already at 50+ trays. So 12k is definitely too much!!I paid about $5k for mine and Im a little over a year in, with about 6 months of refinements left.\\n\\nAlthough it might be a high price it might depend on how serious your case is. That being said, I would still shop around to see what other orthos would charge.Your insurance is probably not paying $6500 of your ortho work either way. Most plans dont have that high of a maximum.I was quoted 12k by one (In the Bay Area.) Just shop around. I settled with a highly rated one, for around $5500 before insurance, so it cost me $2500.Was recommended 30 traysI live in Seattle and paid $6500 for comprehensive and no insurance. 12k definitely sounds a little highIm paying 10k but I have 68 trays and a partial braces. Yours seems highI was suppose to pay 1600 after insurance but the price changed at my next appt. (January price increase) so I ended up paying $2000.Mine cost about $5,000 with dental insurance (adult orthodontics) and a in-network discount. That is for 30 trays.i paid $4500 oop no insurance.Im in the US with no insurance my Invisalign quote was a little over 7k for two years. Like others have said shop around for other quotes my consultation was free hopefully its free for you too.Mine was 5k *before* insurance, Im in Portland, 28 traysHere in Canada Im paying 5500$ for comprehensive starting with 27 trays and refinements after that. Also includes permanent retainer(lingual wire) and plastic retainers with a diamond provider, so that seems very expensiveYou may pay more at this office rhan others as they set their own prices. Some practices, the same case would cost $4000, $6500, $8000 etc. Ive never seenn$12k USD personally.Was it a referral to this specific orthodontist? It\\'s a good idea to shop around and find the right fit for yourself. Find a place who has hours that will suit your schedule, convenient location,  someone you like who tends to run on time (nothing worse than a 4pm appt that doesn\\'t start til 515pm) and cost of treatment too. I\\'d get a second opinion. Cases in my office have been between $4000-$9000 usually for comprehensive treatments.\\nThe place I got my work done before I worked in the field was $7200 but they had a study happening and so my treatment out of pocket was $3500. There are minimum charges but rarely maximum charges so i would bet your ortho is charging what they think they can get away with. I haven\\'t seen anything above $10k myself but I\\'m new so I\\'ve only seen about 300 cases.... and that was $10k CADI have a crossbite and it cost me $6,000. No insurance. Sounds like they are double dipping.Mine are $2,500 after insurance for 30 weeks of trays (essentially 1 week per tray). This is east coast, so I don\\'t know if there\\'s different prices any where else. I\\'d look around for cheaper consults though.My consult was $8,000 total but only because I need a dental implant after my Invisalign treatment is over. Im in New York and was quoted $5,000 out-of-pocket with no insurance for Invisalign treatment for two years. That includes my retainer post treatment and a teeth brightening.Well what is their treatment plan? Are they planning some TADs or additional procedures or appliances? \\n\\nThis may be the case. It also sounds (just by the price) that its a difficult case. What are their objectives versus another? What will you be getting?$5,500 after insurance seems totally normal to me. What did your second consult say?im paying $5000~ out of pocket no insurance in Florida (woulda been 6,000 but they had a special of 1k off). I have a crossbite, overjet, and a lot of spacing in between teeth. You definitely getting scammed with the original price. The after price sounds about average but thats usually pre insurance or if you insurance only covers a littleI have pretty crowded teeth and I am \"only\" getting charged $5500. \\n\\nGo and look around. That\\'s a crazy high amount$5k without insurance 12k hes just might be milking youI had a cross bite. My treatment was $3200. My insurance covered $1500 so my share was $1700. It has since gone up to $4000 I think. Thats for complete treatment and one set of retainers. My dentist is in the top 1% of providers so youd think hed be more. Im east of SeattleThat sounds ridiculously overpriced! I have a pretty bad crossbite and only paid $4,400 with no insurance.I fixed my crossbite with invisalign in Denmark which is a very expensive country to go to the dentist for 6Â\\xa0414.39 U.S. dollars .I got 3 consults, two were similar to each other ($4500 and $5200) and the third which was only my bottom teeth to fix crowding and a snaggle tooth was $9500 lol so yeah Id get another opinion.I have no insurance and Im paying ~5000‚¬ for the Invisalign Fullœ Treatment. That should be around 5300$.I paid RM20,000 (USD4,500\\\\~) for my full treatment, 43 initial trays + 24 refinement trays. This is the standard price for almost all Invisalign treatments in my area regardless of ortho, not sure if that would be a fair comparison but it should give you an idea of how much Invisalign SHOULD cost.Im in the San Francisco Bay Area and I paid $5700. No insurance. Comprehensive so that cost covers everything having to do with the process.I started out with 39 trays, then a refinement of 17, and am now waiting for another refinement batch of trays. I have a cross bite and a deep bite. Im a year in and probably will be in for another. I would tell the 12 grand guy to blow it out his ass!Im paying 8900$ in HCOL area in BC\\n\\n0$ after insurance thoMine was 7,800 before insurance and my teeth are straight but I have a deep bite. 12k seems like kinda a lot but if your teeth are really messed up that might make sense.

Teeth are not like piano keys, they have different shapes and wear differently.\\n\\nWhat, specifically, do you want?I cant see anything wrong with them.I think they look great honestly. Did you at least get your retainer when you quit your ortho? If not they will shift back to their original positionYes, I did. This is with a permanent retainer and I wear a retainer at night multiple times a week.what are you unhappy with?So before I got them taken off, when the bottom teeth were perfectly straight they were pressing against the top front teeth and they were very uncomfortable. The only way they felt comfortable if after 2-3 hours when the bottom teeth shifted backwards some. Thats why you can see that the bottom teeth dont look straight. The middle two are shifted backwards so my left tooth (right in this photo? Looks like its shifted forwards.Before picture?Is there any way to post a photo or would I have to upload one to imgur?It looks like you have the same issue I have- the shape of your two upper front teeth make the ones next to them look crooked. Idk if its the same for you, but when I look at mine from the bottom, theyre perfectly aligned. It drives me crazy to see them and think theyre crooked but everyone reassures me that they look great.Yeah, maybe so! Whenever I head braces when I was younger, they looked perfect, but I never wore my retainer. My ortho back home on the other side of the country said he prefers braces, not Invisalign. I went to someone whos supposed to be the best ortho in LA and speaks at Invisalign conferences. He told me I should get Invisalign over braces, even though I told him I prefer whichever option will work better. You can tell that the teeth beside my front two teeth are a little pushed back when they should be aligned with the front two teeth and the bottom teeth are a little crooked if that makes sense.They look goodLooks great to me!Just got some bondingInvisalign has done the best it can do - it cant whiten or bond your teeth.I dont want them to be bonded. I dont care if there are chips/ridges. My bite was extremely off when I finished treatment so when the bottom teeth were straight, they were pressing up against my front teeth and after 2 hours of not wearing them, my bottom two middle teeth would shift backwards and this is the only way they feel comfortable. I didnt have bite issues before treatment and I had really straight teeth when I was younger after braces but unfortunately didnt wear my retainer. I told the ortho that I was open to braces or Invisalign, whichever one would give me the best results.Ohhhhh ok I understand what youre getting at now. I had the same issue as you - then I has another set of refinements and it was corrected by that. How long was your plan for?I was in Invisalign for nearly a year. I think I initially had a set of 14 aligners and I had maybe 3-5 sets of refinements. He wanted to take them off and I told him about the issue and he ordered another set of refinements. I shouldve asked for another set instead of getting them taken off, but his office was so unorganized and I kind of felt like he was being insensitive, so I decided to just get them taken off and accept them how they were. Also I was under the impression that it was normal for my bite to feel off until they settled so I was like eh maybe theyll be fine after a few weeks of getting them taken off.Awwwww Im so sorry! UG!I appreciate your sympathy! Yeah the bite feels fine now because the bottom teeth shifted some (even with a permanent retainer), so Im just happy my mouth feels fine now and they do look better than before..

They were posted at the same exact time.I only created one post. Not sure how this happened.\\n\\nThanks btw!Your smile looks really good.\\n\\nI guess you\\'re upset that it\\'s not perfectly symmetrical.  But it\\'s because of tooth shape. Your right front tooth has a straight edge and your left one has a concave edge.  A couple of the other teeth are clearly worn or have chipped unevenly. This can\\'t be fixed by straightening alone. This is what bonding and veneers are for.\\n\\nThe main thing I think is just bonding/shaving the front upper incisors, and maybe the lateral incisors, to make them symmetrical. My ortho did this for me; I\\'m not sure why yours didn\\'t offer.I dont care if there are chips/ridges. My bite was extremely off when I finished treatment so when the bottom teeth were straight, they were pressing up against my front teeth and after 2 hours of not wearing them, my bottom two middle teeth would shift backwards and this is the only way they feel comfortable.

I told the ortho that I was open to braces or Invisalign, whichever one would give me the best results. I also dont like that the two teeth beside my front two teeth are pushed backwards when they should be in line with the front two teeth. This is how mine were when I originally got my braces off. My ortho back home told me I should get braces instead of Invisalign, and now I think I understand why. Its prob not possible to get the results Id like with Invisalign. But I didnt go back to him bc hes on the other end of the country. I went to one of the best orthos in LA who speaks at Invisalign conferences bc I wanted to make sure I was in good hands.\\n\\nThey definitely look better than they did before which Im happy about, but Id hope if Im going to one of the best that I wouldnt end up with bite issues/crooked teeth in the end.Totally legitimate to have those issues and want further improvements! It just isn\\'t obvious to any of us from the picture, and it\\'s almost certainly not visible to anyone who sees you IRL, either.\\n\\nI\\'m actually somewhat similar, there are some imperfections with my results, though my ortho was up front with \"that\\'s not possible with invaslign, you\\'d need braces\" and \"that\\'s not possible without extractions\" when I asked about fixing them. I\\'d be very very frustrated if I said I was open to braces and the ortho put me in invisalign and ended up with just obviously worse results :(I agree with you!

Like finish it as quickly as you can after lol, or you can take your time finishing your coffee and then brush?\\n\\nI normally kinda take my time with my coffee and at work I often dont even finish it till after lunchtime or later. My strategy in the morning was going to be to make two espresso shots, mix it with some cream and down it real quick before I brush and put my aligners back in. But I tried that today and downing two shots of espresso.easier said than done lol. But I also dont have a lot of time in the morning and Im trying to maximize how long I wear my aligners so sitting there and sipping my coffee for half an hour before I put my aligners in wouldnt really work.\\n\\nSorry, I know this all sounds silly, but I legitimately need to know how people handle this! (I was thinking of just switching to caffeine pills while Im on Invisalign too ‚)4 day changes? Who cares drink coffee with them in. By the time they\\'ll start looking stained you\\'ll be swapping.I nurse a 16oz cup of Starbucks coffee every morning (with coconut milk creamer and Truvia)  and an 8oz watermelon Redbull (pink) every afternoon with my aligners in. Dont brush until its snack time but I do swish with water throughout and sometimes mouthwash when Im done with the drink. Havent noticed any staining other than some normal discoloration of the trays by day 4/5ish, but its not noticeable when aligners are on, only notice they are more yellow-clear than the blue-clear they were on Day 1. Im on 7 day changes. I also brush my aligners with toothpaste (and a soft brush) every time I brush my teeth (which is usually every time Ive eaten). My doctor is aware of these habits and has no issues. Like you, I considered how much my life would need to change to accommodate this new regimen and now that Ive gotten used to it, I realize giving up my normal coffee routine would do more harm than good.I drink my coffee with my aligners in. I drink everything with them in. Swish with water when youre done.Hot coffee?Ha well I make my coffee with half the mug with milk / almond milk which is cold from the fridge so my coffee is never hot to begin with. It\\'s immediately drinking temperature.\\n\\nIf I\\'m out and order a drink that\\'s hot I wait till it\\'s cooled a bit then drink it. Same with tea I make at home. My trays have never warped.I do the same! I also only drink my hot drinks once theyve cooled significantly, Ive never drank them hot even before Invisalign. I was on 7 day changes and I never had an issue with staining or warping.wow interesting. maybe i should give that a try. I have a habit of sipping on my coffee then get busy with things and forget to put my trays back. ends up being hours of having my trays out for no reason.Drink the coffee, lay off the sugar if you use a lot of it, give your mouth a good swim with water throughout and when done.\\n\\nYeah, your aligners will discolour a tinge, but noting terrible (it looks worse when you take them out than when you\\'re actually wearing them)\\n\\nI\\'ll nurse a coffee most the morning, I\\'d never have my aligners in if I had to have them out to drink.  Be sure to brush and clean well at meal times.Ive been a bit more cautious and now just drink my coffee with my breakfast and then brush etc straight after.  I sometimes miss the hot drinks when Im working but this wont last forever!Drink coffee as is just not hot, then add a bit of milk before lunch and brush right after. I do weekly changes and havent noticed much staining at all. I do IF so I dont eat till lunch timeI drink two huge coffees a day, lingering for about an hour each. That still leaves me a couple hours to eat. I brush after my early morning coffee but just rinse after the second one. Invisalign hasnt impacted my coffee habits at all.I use a straw specifically made for hot drinks! The brand is Koffie but I got it from The Package Free online shop! Its great and I can leisurely sip my coffee while minimizing its contact with my teeth or trays. Also the strangeness of drinking a hot drink with a straw honestly goes away quite quickly lolDo you find these Koffie straws better than regular ones?For hot drinks, yes! Its sort of nit picky but when drinking hot drinks with a metal straw, I feel like the straw gets super hot and then its uncomfortable and then with a plastic straw, Ive had a couple of them warp from the hot liquid! So the Koffie straw has been a game changer for coffee and tea! Ill honestly probably use it after Invisalign also to avoid coffee staining my teeth!I work in my home office, so I am lucky enough to be able to schedule everything around the way I want. Can\\'t imagine how I would schedule it if I needed to be going out and have meals elsewhere. I always make coffe first thing in the morning and before Invisalign I was drinking it for 45, 60 minutes. I was also wondering what to do with Invisalign, and decided to give myself 30 minutes in the morning to drink it and be faster on other \"meals\".\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t drink it with aligners in even though it says on ortho instructions that I can. I only drink water when I have them in and so far so good.I\\'ve been drinking my daily iced coffee on the way to work/at work with my aligners in through a straw since my 5th tray or so (i\\'m now finished with 22h of retainers)... I drink water afterwards, but i\\'ve never had any staining issues and my check-ups at the dentist for cavities are always OK.I drink 2 to 3 coffees a day but I always remove the trays before drinking since the Brazilian expresso is very strong and concentrated. It would stain the trays in a noticeable wayI have 4 day changes my entire treatment. I drink whatever I want at any pace I want, and swish water afterwards.. 4 day changes you have nothing to worry about staining rly. It you care a lot about it though just get a cheap sonic cleaner and sonic every nightUse a straw maybeI take them out. Drink coffee for about 30 mins. Swoosh with water and put them back in.Yea I do. It\\'s totally fine just wash ya trays at the end of the day Or use a metal strawI, too, am a coffee sipper. I sometimes take an hour to finish my morning cup. I typically sip my coffee with aligners in and drink/swish water as I am drinking the coffee. I\\'ve always had a ton of water while drinking coffee, so this was not a big change for me. \\n\\nWhen I finish my coffee, I remove my aligners, eat breakfast, and brush. I\\'m not saying this is the \\\\*right\\\\* way to do things, but I haven\\'t had any issues, thus far.I only do iced coffee with a straw :)Use a straw!I just got mine today. I\\'m planning to take my trays out for 30 minutes in the AM to drink my coffee then brush. Maybe even eat some oatmeal.\\n\\nI kind of want to break the \\'sip a drink all morning\\' habit anyway. That said, I don\\'t put any sugar in mine - crap, I switched from cow milk to oat milk, it\\'s got carbs...well...yeah.\\n\\nI don\\'t get coffee out except Sunday morning coffee at church, and since I change trays on Monday I\\'m probably going to drink it with trays in then anyway.And honestly, if the biggest risk is staining my trays, I\\'m not super worried...I\\'d hate for them to be nasty looking, but a little dingy?I use to bring my coffee to the office with me daily. Since starting Invisalign I had to change that. I now enjoy my coffee in the morning at home while i get ready for work & my trays are soaking in denture cleaner. I brush, pop them back in and go on with my day. In the event that i want a mid day coffee, I always make it iced with a straw and off course make sure to rinse after. 14/40It 4 days just drink it!

Im almost 2 weeks in and will switch to my 2nd set of trays Monday night, so those are my tips as someone who is still really early in the process.My ortho gives me all that stuff for free whenever I come in for an appointment, so it may be worth asking before buying.I assumed mine would give me everything I needed, and instead she just told me I could buy accessories on the Invisalign website, so I had nothing for a couple days while I waited for my Amazon delivery.Mine gives me all that stuff if I need it too. I got a pul tool, and every visit I get two or three chewies.Two or three chewies wouldnt last me a week. I would definitely have to buy more even if she had given me some. Maybe theyre better quality than what I got from Amazon, though.Two or three in a week?!?! Are you using them with bare teeth lol? Jk, yeah those must be crappy indeed. Ask your ortho for some next time you go in.Can you provide details of these products (possibly Amazon title). Starting next month too.Of course! There are two different kinds of Chewies.

You should have been provided a video that shows how your teeth will be moved?im not sure why you got downvoted. if my dentist didnt show me my video and talk me through the whole process before i committed, i would have sought a second opinion.I have no idea. It was a legitimate question I had. The clincheck video is part of the Invisalign process. I hope OP asks for that bc it should be available & provided to her. I previewed the video before I signed an agreement & paid. I would not have agreed to move forward if I didnt know what the treatment plan was.My ortho didnt send it till I asked. (They are understaffed and have generally been horrible about communicating.) OP should ask!Some don't get it until they pick up their trays, some don't get it at allI was wondering the same thing. I was emailed my clincheck (treatment plan) as soon as I approved it. My Dr. showed it to me before ordering my first set of trays.\\n\\nOP, ask your Dr. to email your treatment plan. They shouldn't be withholding this info from you.It will definitely hurt for a while, but that should lessen over time. Your teeth might be a little sore after changing to the next aligner but nothing unbearable. Dont worry if you dont see progress right away because it can be slow, but it definitely is working!

Take it one day at a time. As everyone else has said it will get better every day.  Try and wear them for as long as possible. Tray minder has been a good friend to me ........All the best!!!!Ur making the right move.Ibuprofen will be your friend. Don't start a new tray the day before something important, I had to switch my trays one day later because I work in office on Wednesday, and my new tray made my jaw ache so bad I had to go home early, was even crying in my car. Though mind you, long acting dull achey pain is much worse for me than sudden sharp pain. It's more of a will thing for me I guess? Like it becomes such a neusance it makes me upset. \\nEach new tray hurts less though.\\nI still can't really eat hard or chewy foods the first two days with my new trays. So keep it simple. And avoid curry or anything with tumeric or yellowish staining pigment. Probably stay away from beets too. I had curry rice the first week and it stained my buttons yellow. Luckily I found a whitening pen that actually worked, but it took a few days to get my teeth back to where they were. \\nI also like to keep my Invisalign In a cup of peroxide and water while I eat to make sure they're extra clean. Try to keep your trays in for 23 hours. It's not always possible and that's ok. I've been a little less good with them lately cos I eat in the car on the way to work, but I try to not leave them out too long for multiple days. \\nAlso plan your meals. Snacking becomes tedious because you need to brush your teeth every time after. So make sure you're eating plenty of filling stuff in one sitting. \\nOne last thing: I switched from a soft to a medium toothbrush because the soft brush wasn't getting my back teeth super clean. It's irritating at first, and make sure to be gentle around your gums. And floss when you can. Don't want to get cavities in your soon to be straight teeth. Best of luck!My ortho specifically asked me to use paracetamol if needed, and not ibuprofen. Apparently there is some evidence that suggests ibuprofen hinders the movement of the teeth. Have any of you heard similar comments?It has to do with the inflammation. Ibuprofen relieves inflammation specifically but the extra blood flow and swelling (also known as inflammation) is actually necessary for the good health of the roots and it speeds up the tooth movement. Chewies are good pain relief for that persistent dull acheI've never heard such a thing but I know just taking too much ibuprofen in general isn't a great idea so I try to switch up whichever NSAIDS I'm using to avoid any issues. Also my teeth are moving surprisingly fast. I'm on day 3 of my new liner and it snapped on really easy.This is what my dentist said, also.I like to change my trays first thing in the morning of my tray change. I get through it during the day, Rather than do like most people and changing them before bed and wake up still achey and sore. But thats just me.\\n\\nYoull find what works for you.Get some dental wax, chewies, and an ortho key. Getting them on and off your teeth might be a little difficult the first week but it gets easier and easier. The trays will probably rub the inside of your mouth in uncomfortable ways and the dental wax will feel heavenly when you're trying to go to sleep at night. Chewies will be good for keeping your trays tight, teeth moving quickly, and natural pain relief.\\nWatch a lot of YouTube videos. There are so many reviews and testimonials and I think you'll be much better prepared to get through that first week if you listen to people talking about what it was like. I think your teeth will end up gorgeous and your smile will be Hollywood ready. Just know, it will be nothing but regret for the first week. But those growing pains don't last long. Good luck! And congratulations!This will be a fascinating one to see through. I look forward to your updates!Id like to add that if a tray is really cutting up your mouth, use a nail file on the edges. I had to do that on several trays, and my ortho told me to do that if needed. I bought Crest Aligner Care tablets to soak them every morning, and my trays stay nice n clear. Chapstick will be your best friend. Mountain Oceans Lip Trip is the absolute best, followed closely by Portland Bee Balm.You might start out having a bit of discomfort seeing how your teeth are positioned. Just know it's a process and you will be glad you did it.  You've got plenty of support right here on REDDIT!! You will be just fine.1. Water, lots of water. Drink tons of it. I used to be a snacker and had to give it up because I didn't want to have to go through the whole floss/brush routine between meals. Also, removing and putting the trays in can be very painful during the first couple of days, so I would just OMAD if it was particularly painful. \\n\\n2. Use tray cleaner tablets at least once a day. You can let the trays soak while you are eating. I started breaking the tablets in half to make them last longer. Brushing with water isn't enough to keep them from getting smelly, at least for me.Ä° just started Invisalign 2 weeks ago. I'm on my second tray now. Ä°t's been a huge change. No snacking that much.

I almost had a panic attack the first week lol Using the tool/hook to remove the bottom tray was the only way I could get it out.

Its the same thing for the bottom tray.You will absolutely find a way to do it, promise. My husband 3D printed some hooks for me and I used them for the first few months, but after a while I learned my fingernails did a better and faster job. You'll figure it out.Hinge the aligner off of your back molar and then grip the back portion of the aligner with your pointer finger and thumb and lift upward.Use your nails.a guy who cuts his nails too closely lolPul tool from Amazon. It does get easier over time though. I just use the pul tool when Im in publicIve just ordered a pull type tool from Amazon. Im on day 2, and my nails are very soft, so Im finding it harder to get one side out than the other. I can see why people stop eating snacks.When I first got mine I found that breathing through my mouth for like 20 seconds to dry the saliva off helps to get a grip on them, even without nails! Grab around the molar from both sides, squeeze, and pull/pushAfter a day or two itll feel so much easier. Just be gentle, take your time, and dont overthink it. :)Even with pull tools, my trays are difficult because my teeth are all different heights, I have significant cross bite (I mean teeth at 45 degree angle). I have to work them off very carefully alternating sides and between leveraging off the back and front of them. I find very yeah has a different knack to removal because they are targeting different teeth but I imagine the straighter they become the easier they will go on/offGet you a ortho key. Honestly I dont even use mine the first 2 weeks are the hardest trying to figure it out but now I can pop them out without a mirror. (On tray 6) also start from the inside back molars first.I bought special hooks to remove the trays. However the pain is real …Itll get easier, my first set felt like it was gonna rip my teeth out. Youll get better at it and the other trays are much easier in my opinionI got mine like a week ago, it's already easier!\\n\\nThe hard/painful part for me was getting them off the attachments. I only have 3 total (2 upper, 1 lower) and they're all on the same side. I use a PUL tool on the inside plus my thumb nail on the outside and lift up one side from my molars, then the other side. Then I sneak a nail under the front, and gently push it forward around the front towards the attachment side. Gives it a bit of room to work out without making me want to cry.\\n\\nIt was completely painless today and takes me like half the time already. :)i got mine tuesday, i just do it how they taught me in office. start from the back molar and lift it off teeth on both sides. then grab both sides and pull forward and up (down if doing top) first day seemed to hurt/get stuck now its slightly easierI nearly had a panic attack the first day because I felt like they were trapped in my mouth. Now I can zip them out quickly with a quick lift with a fingernail. Get the orthokey to help get used to it. Start at the inside of a back molar and lift up and toward your cheek, unzipping as you go. You can pull harder than you think. You wont break the aligners or rip off an attachment or extract a tooth.I started yesterday - find the upper tray fine to remove but the bottom one is a real tricksy one. Have had to stop and take a few calming breaths every time I've done it! I'm assuming it'll get easier.I completely understand! I was constantly worried that I was going to detach one of my attachments when I was removing my trays.

My bottom front teeth would shift within 2 hours and thats the only way they would feel comfortable. He tried to fix it with a round of refinements, but after feeling discouraged with his office for awhile (disorganization, and he kept trying to take them off even though they were clearly not done), I was like screw it im over it. I wonder if I should reach out to his office to see if theres anything I can do or if I should get a second opinion.IANAL and I'm only on tray 2 myself, but I'm going to assume any second opinion will cost you, while anything with your current Ortho would be covered as part of your current plan/contract. I would try the option that doesn't cost me anything more first personally.Can you elaborate what makes you unhappy exactly?So before I got them taken off, when the bottom teeth were perfectly straight they were pressing against the top front teeth and they were very uncomfortable.

A lot of people prefer Invisalign because they dont like the look of braces and ignore the fact that Invisalign might not get them the desired look like braces. The ortho who did my braces when I was younger told me I should go back into braces instead of Invisalign and now I see why. I went to the top ortho in LA who speaks at Invisalign conferences all the time. I asked him if I should do Invisalign or braces, because I wanted what would give me the best result and he recommended Invisalign. My teeth definitely dont look at good as after I got my braces off and my bite was off whenever I was done with Invisalign treatment.Im learning this the hard way \\xadI dont have anything constructive to add other than telling you I can also commiserate because Im 17/20 trays in and not satisfied at all and am pretty bummed about my dentist saying the results I want arent achievable..?! >:(I know a lot of people including me wish they had teeth as great as yoursbeyond first world problemsYes, first world problems for sure. But I think its pretty understandable to be disappointed by crooked bottom teeth and a bite thats off when I chose to go to one of the top Invisalign specialists in the US.They look perfectly straight.

Personally, I\\'d do a trial run at home and see how good he is at keeping up with everything with no reminders from you.\\n\\nIf you\\'re really worried and have the money/time perhaps you could order replacement trays for that week from your orthodontist and give them to an adult in case he loses or damages his trays while at camp. In any case, definitely let the camp know he has Invisalign. Camp counselors are used to reminding kids to use the bathroom. Reminding a camper to take care of their trays would be no trouble at all.\\n\\nIf Invisalign is right for your family, then it\\'s right for your family. Even braces come with increased responsibility like flossing between the wires. Plus, kids still have to wear retainers after treatment with braces. I remember a boy in elementary school who threw his retainers away at lunch. They had the custodian come and dig them out of the trash. When they gave it to the boy, he just popped it back in in his mouth, so maybe go over hygiene best practices before camp...Thank you - I know my son. \\n\\nWe will be together all summer (I work from home, he\\'ll be out of school).

Invisalign is still fairly noticeable when you are close to someone, especially with all the attachments, but it is more comfortable and less noticeable than braces.While I\\'m not an expert, what I\\'ve gathered reading here is that with Invisalign, it\\'s not about the amount of work to be done, it\\'s about the type of work to be done.\\n\\nThere are some tricky movements that require braces. But if you\\'ve got a mouth that appears to need a lot of work to be done, but it turns out none of that work is complex enough to warrant braces, then Invisalign will probably work fine.Im the same but you can get clear braces! Honestly Invisalign are a lot of work as well and they can take much longer - if I was to go with them even though they wouldnt fully correct my teeth (as per my previous comment, I dont seem the point), itd take 30 months over 18 with braces. Im 34 and asked for the quickest most effective way to give me a Julia Roberts smile - her teeth are amazing!! - and was told braces so going with that.I have a lot of work to do and although my teeth are a bit straighter than yours, I have a top front tooth (lat incisor) that\\'s completely behind the other front teeth. My ortho is always so amazed with my progress and always says that he wouldn\\'t have been able to achieve this kind of movement with traditional braces. Aside from that tooth I have some crowding and I will finish my treatment with no extractions necessary. And I was supposed to get ceramic braces! I was convinced my case wasn\\'t fit for aligners, but the technology is so advanced now that they can basically fix anything. You can check my posts history for a pic of my teeth for reference.It may depend on whether you have bite issues or not. Although invisalign can correct bite issues as well. \\nIf youre able to do invisalign, maybe look into some cosmetic bonding before you do your scans. I went to my dentist for some routine fillings before I began my treatment and he went rogue and did some bonding that caused me to be rescanned lol. He didnt charge me though and to be honest the bonding really helped. They told me it should shorten my treatment time. So we shall seeNAD/ Braces! Go with something traditional and well studied. I used Invisalign and ended up with a fracture in my front tooth, a fracture in a crowned molar ( now needs an implant for $11K) and another smaller fractured tooth (not visible). They work differently. Invisalign tilts the teeth rather than moving them (that\\'s a very high level description). Question the ficial motives of the provider before you make your decision and do more research!I have the same crowding as you and an open bite and my ortho recommended Invisalign. I also have a crown and he said no problem we just left off an attachment.My bottom teeth are quite like yours and I have just started Invisalign. Im having to have an extraction to make space and will also have to have IPR. He did mention the possibility that if it didnt track that they might swap the bottom over to fixed braces but will see how it goes.Check out my page, especially [this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/t30rzj/6_weeks_left_unless_my_ortho_changes_his_mind/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\nMy ortho pushed for traditional clear braces but said I -could- do Invisalign if I really didnt want braces. Here I am 19 months later. Im so happy with my decision. Im getting some bonding done on the front teeth but thats still a month away. Good luck to you! Oh wow our teeth are similar. \\nIm in #4 and seeing improvements already.Good luck to you! I saw improvements early too, especially with my bite. It goes by so fast and is 100% worth it.Thanks! I need bonding afterwards. Im 38 and my teeth have been my biggest self criticism. Now I can finally afford to fix them.Im 45, started when I was 43, tons of issues. And its working out very well for me and Im glad to not have a metal mouth. You can do it! Ill end with over 100 trays easily.Either.I always thought that I was not eligible for Invisalign but my ortho said Invisalign was better fr me than traditional braces.  Talk to a good ortho. You may be surprised...Th only limitation that Invis has is if you can afford the treatment :)You can absolutely go with Invisalign. I have three trays left Ive been in them eight months and I cannot believe the difference in my teeth.It really depends on your orthodontist and what they recommend. My teeth are straighter than yours but I still got told no to Invisalign because they wouldnt fully correct my bite - both my dentist and orthodontist said the same. I hate that I cant get the Invisalign but I figure whats the point if they dont fix everything?All treament modalities are technique sensitive meaning it will come down to a good doctor, diagnosis and treament plane.  Guy linked in this  thread is a perfect example.  Also why if one ortho says it cant be done you go to another.Front teeth are much easier to move so even severe cases can be treated with Invisalign. But ultimately, we arent orthodontists and can only see some of your teeth. If your molars have issues or if youve got a malocclusion, you may need braces.\\n\\nFwiw though, I have a crossbite on my very back teeth which is almost impossible to move with Invisalign. Some regular dentists who offer Invisalign told me Id need braces to fix my teeth. When I went to a very experienced, highly credentialed orthodontist, he suggested that we do braces and Invisalign combined. Brackets on my back two teeth for a while until my bite is fixed (thankfully not very noticeable), then Invisalign for my front teeth. That might be an option for you too even if your molars need a lot of work.Braces are easierMaybe schedule some consults and see what they say!If you have the choice. I would choose Invisalign.

Is there more than one cycle of trays? After joining this group Ive noticed that most people have a lot more trays than me and their teeth arent nearly as crooked as mine.[deleted]Yeah I also have a pretty bad overbite , Im not doubting it takes time, Im saying It doesnt feel right I was only given 20 trays for how crooked my teeth areI have 14 and I think Im changing them every 2 weeks? They said 6 months until Im done and mine are pretty minor. Im getting the dot things put on in 2 weeks and Im asking more questions the. Ill be switching to tray 3 then.Yeah I should have asked more questions but honestly I was just excited and ready to get them on. My teeth are super crowded and crooked on the bottom so thats why I confused I only got 20 trays to switch out every weekNo expert here as Im a week and a half in but maybe spacing them out more if theyre relatively straight is easy? Or maybe your guy is shady. No idea. Ask more questions and hopefully you feel better about it all!Maybe.. Ive also had my wisdom teeth and a few molars removed so maybe the extra space in my mouth will fast track everythuntI would assume youll have refinements, which is just more trays after the initial set once they see how your teeth are moving.Yeah the only thing they mentioned at my dentist was after these 20 trays I will have to wear another type of retainer for 3 months then Ill be done and nightly use only. \\nI got excited when it was only estimated to take 5 months but now Im feeling like there is nooooo wayAre you doing Invisalign Express? Ive read somewhere that route is usually much quicker compared to traditional food InvisalignNot that I know of, I think its just regularCongrats on your journey!! I started at 23 (a few days before I turned 24 (last year)) and still ongoing! It's a journey but it'll be worth it in the end! \\n\\nAs for the # of trays, it really depends on how much fixing there is. If there are more bite problems then it'll take longer. If it's just teeth that are crooked then I assume it'll take a shorter amount of time. Usually people get refinements. I wasn't told anything about it but I'm sure I'm getting some because my estimated plan is 2 years despite not having many teeth issues (we are fixing my bite). Good luck!! ¡That makes sense about the bite correction! \\nI have an overbite too but idk if they are doing anything to fix that, I just have regular trays and attachments. Good luck on your treatment :)I have 42 trays. My bottom crowding will be completely addressed by tray 20. Im on tray 12 right now and the improvement is pretty amazing. The remaining 22 trays will continue to work on my top bite issues including a medium overbite. Since my teeth and bones are old, I have two week changes and have over a year to go without factoring in refinements. Be happy with your planit will work if you trust the process.Yeah so if your overcrowding on the bottom teeth is on track to be fixed by week 20 then that might make sense why I will only need 20 weeks since that is my main issue. Thank you for your response!Your teeth might not be as crooked as you think either, or might just not take as long to move. I had over-crowding and some crooked teeth that needed fixed and I had 23 trays. My teeth really werent terribly bad, but I originally felt that was a lot of trays. I was started with every two weeks, then switched to weekly change-outs. They might give you refinements too, if needed at the end. But assuming you stay on track, the projection is usually pretty good, from what I can tell for most people. I have no refinements. Just waiting on my retainer.Yeah Im thinking too, Ive had all my wisdom teeth removed and a few molars extracted due to cavities. Maybe because I have alot of room in my mouth the overcrowding can be solved quicker?? Idk thoTypically if your teeth need more movement by the end of your 20 trays, youll get another scan and more trays added if needed. If not then youre good to go.

Still much to fix, but looking forward to further improvement. Can recommend physio therapy as well, helps me a lot.I've been in invisalign for a little over a year and it's greatly helped my TMJ symptoms! A few trays made it worse but once those trays were done it was fine!So I got it for cosmetic reasons, but improving my tmj was a hopeful bonus. I was told I'd need jaw surgery to fully correct, but I didn't think my case was severe enough for that so I compromised. I'm on 35/40 and getting refinements soon. My jaw still cracks when I open it wide (which I don't much with rubber bands) but I haven't had any bad pain in a long time!! Not cured, I knew that wouldn't happen, but definitely improved!I voted Im finished but Im not actually finished and my tmj symptoms went away a long time ago. Probably 8 months into treatment my symptoms were completely gone. But I do agree with the other post on here, it did get a lot worse before it got betterCurrently worsening symptoms. Might have to stop. Waiting on next appointment to confirm. Sucks.My treatment is still ongoing but TMJ pain went away from tray 1. When I put the first tray in the aligners forced my jaw into a totally different position to which I wasnt used to. And for some weeks after when taking them off to eat I had a click in my jaw.\\n\\nSometimes I still notice that my joint area is a bit sensitive, but not like anything I had before the treatment where my jaw would lock into an open position + that awful pain.This is my experience too. As soon as the first tray was in, the pain was improved. I had (had!) a crossbite that was forcing the right joint to sit wrong and the trays helped move my jaw into a more comfortable position. Before starting invisalign I couldn't open my mouth more than half an inch some weeks. My jaw would pop out of place while I was sleeping and I'd wake up with it locked. \\n\\nI still have a few trays left from my first round and I'll likely need more to fix the posterior open bite I now have, but I'm thrilled to no longer be in constant pain.I just started treatment for my open bite.

But am wondering what others think that have had Invisalign or currently do. Will I regret getting my trays the day before? Should I reschedule my appointment for after I get back? I really want to start as soon as possible. Thanks!!My opinion is to wait till after your vacation to start, because it takes a bit of time to get used to the process of removing, brushing, replacing, etc. And you may be self-conscious about the attachments at the beginning. And you cant just eat and drink when you feel like it. Im on tray 4 and struggled for the first couple of weeks.I was uncomfortable and mildly miserable the first week. Id delay the start until you get back from vacation so you can truly enjoy yourself.I think this is the option I am leaning towards. Id rather struggle at home. Lol.I would wait.

My vacation wasn't food-focused and I found the trays didn't interfere too much, although I was very relaxed about the rules lol. I certainly had my trays out a lot more than I should have, and it was awkward to try and yank them off at a fancy restaurant; or try to find a bathroom to rinse the trays while at the beach/on a hike. \\n\\n If I could do it all over, I would have waited. You'll probably be better off starting after your vacation.Yes, you will regret it. Reschedule your appointment and enjoy your vacation. Your teeth will likely hurt, your mouth and lips will be dry, and dealing with the upkeep, especially when youre new, will be a pain.I just got mine and I'm on tray two. My attachments fell off a LOT and I had to go in frequently to get them back on. Think this might be more important to you than the pain because it's not that badWait. Its not that its œbad\\x9d but If its only 5 days it definitely affects meals, snacks and drinking, which in my opinion are things that make vacations fun. Enjoy and then focus on it when you get home. 5 days will not make a difference in the end but they could change how you enjoy your trip. Have fun!Just pick up the trays but wait until you get home to start wearing them - 5 days is barely going to hold up your treatment.\\n\\nI'm on day 4 and although they are a lot more comfortable now, I'm still very much getting the hang of how to handle eating and drinking and taking them in and out - I'll happily wear them on holiday once I've adapted but I don't think I'd want to be doing that in the first few days.Youll be fineWait.I am on day 5 and if I had been on vacation the last few days this really would have ruined it. However I don't think it would have bothered me much to have the little glue spots put on my teeth.  So I could see having the fitting appointment, getting any needed glue tabs put on teeth and being able to slide the trays in the second I got home.wow did i write this?? im in the same boat. my only worry is i will have attachments, im wondering if ill be able to eat without discomfort with only the attachments on there (bc i heard theyre sharp at first) until i actually start using the trays when i get backI didnt know they were sharp at first! I think Im going to wait based on all the responses. Id rather enjoy my vacation and not have them to worry about.I started mine the night before I went on a 4 day trip. I was fine. They were a little tender but I just had panadol/tylenol as needed and it was totally manageable. My ortho said I could wait but she wanted me to start my second tray as scheduled, so I was more scared of being 4 days behind and in pain on my second tray so decided to just bite the bullet. No regrets! Yeah it was a little annoying to get used to and a little tender but it certainly didnt ruin a lovely time away. Everyones experience is different but. Just do what feels right for you.I wouldnt worry about the discomfort, youll get used to that quick. The upkeep is definitely tedious, especially on vacation where your meal times are not as fixed. Honestly, if its only 5 days, Id put it off just so you can properly enjoy your vacation. Youll be fine either way though!Thank you! Thats what Im worried about mostly.

I cant refuse to eat when we go outside for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  We eat with friends often, and pop by dessert shops and cafes often.  \\nMy solution is to eat and just quickly brush after each meal.  I wait until all my order has arrived before I take off my trays and I generally eat pretty fast.  I excuse myself to brush and come back with the trays on.  Then if they are still eating Ill just sip water.  No one has an issue with me at all, they know Im on a timer so its ok.  \\nUsually breakfast and lunch will take up 30-45min total.  If there is dessert, I sort of cheat depending on the type of dessert. If its something soft Ill just eat with the trays on and brush afterwards to save time.   Then at the end of the day I soak my trays and floss properly.  I also use intradental toothbrush because my gum dentist recommended I use them.  So far my ortho has been very pleased with my oral hygiene. \\n\\nI actually think if you have a water floss it will\\nbe useful since its faster than flossing.  It cant replace flossing so at least at the end of the day you still need to floss.  But it can help dislodge food quickly and save you some time during the day or when you are out and flossing is not really possible.  \\n\\nBut of course the actual advice from my ortho is œincrease a day or two if you didnt hit enough hours\\x9d.  But I like my current 7day schedule as I change on Sunday night so its easy to remember.  \\n\\nMy ortho did give me the clear to eat with the trays on when Im traveling.  He says the main issue is staining which wont look nice in pictures.  \\nBut if you really need more wear time, and you have short tray changes maybe your ortho can give you the clear for eating with trays too.Great tips, thank you!I just brush/floss exactly as I did before Invisalign. I take out my trays every time I want to eat/drink, then pop them in right after. It doesnt have to be a big production. Invisalign hasnt changed anything for me at all except removing trays before eating.Eat more at meal times. Take trays out if you want a snack.I had a sink at work so that helped. I carried a toothbrush and paste in my pocket, got so comfortable with it at the end that i could brush anywhereOne thing that helped me especially in the beginning was drinking meal replacement/protein shakes/smoothies through a straw with my trays in. It helped me get some extra calories and manage my hunger without having to take off the trays so often. And if your teeth are too sore to chew comfortably it helps too. You can swish your mouth with water in between sips, and/or take the trays off briefly to brush your teeth property when you're finished, to minimize the risk of cavities from sugar getting stuck under your trays.Ive done this for the past 2 years. Works!Make a small pouch with a toothbrush, toothpaste and floss, you can even get everything in travel size if you dont like carrying it around, ooor you can even just leave one at work, or in your car or something. You dont have to get up and go to brush asap either, even gargling with water and popping them back in and brushing when you get the soonest chance is fine as long as you dont wait forever. I munch on road trips and just brush quickly in gas station bathrooms, youll get used to it and find your groove soon, for now, eat and figure as you go.\", 'labels': ['oral hygiene', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'self-consciousness', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'tray time management', 'financial concerns', 'facial appearance'], 'scores': [0.249922513961792, 0.1598639190196991, 0.14113709330558777, 0.13911856710910797, 0.1280168890953064, 0.09409917891025543, 0.08784189075231552]}, {'sequence': \"Invisalign and Crown LengtheningIt looks fab!!!Thanks!Looks amazing!!

Glad to learn it\\'s not the end of the world lol.I have similar concerns however, my dentist said that a lot of the recession is actually due to the gums being healthier and less inflamed.

The expertise comes from the orthodontist and Invisalign (their vast database of previous procedures is what you're paying for as the plastic is cheap).

I also very much value his opinion. It is why I chose him. I am thankful it took less time, but his expertise didnt have much to do with my teeth moving any quicker.

That being said, mine is taking a year longer than expected and Im very grateful to not be charged more because of that!I appreciate the opinion from you and I value it more coming from an orthodontist. I guess I am a little confused as to how that makes sense though? Its not like the expertise moved my teeth quicker? And I would imagine the quote I received and paid for included twice as many visits to see him, which he would have wanted to charge for.\\n\\nEdit: obviously expertise helps in the process please dont read too much into that question. My teeth never had any attachments. They moved easier than he must have imagined or he thought I would be less compliant with the treatment possibly.Why he should pay more? The orthodontist just did his job and when he finished his job earlier, he can focus on the other patients or have more free time. It is like me as employee telling my boss, I finished my work earlier, I will now go home and you will pay me more. What you are saying has no sense, you are just defending the orthodontist because you can identify yourself in his placeHe's not paying more.. he's paying the same.

Or do you think I am identifying with USPS or Amazon shipping services now?No still does not make sense. I would be happier for sure but there is a contract between you and your patient. He wants a result, the orthodontist did it earlier but just finished his task, there is no reason to pay him more and if the treatment lasts more time do you refund your patient?The commenter is not being literal, they aren't actually going to make anyone pay extra. Just like no one would actually get a refund for a good outcome. They're just making a point that a lot of people WOULD pay extra to be done in 9 months over 18 months.

I hope to god you never get into any type of management or leadership position.Man tell me where I am wrong, posting this kind of generalities is easy. The duration of a treatment is an estimation. The output is what is important. If it takes more time, does that make the orthodontist not skilled? Before starting my Invisalign treatment I visited many orthodontists and I picked up the one who told me it will the most time to fix it, because I had an impression she was the best.

Could be wrong though.No. You pay for a treatment plan as a whole, not based on the amount of trays or time itll take. Just that itll get done.Thank you for the straightforward not snarky answer.My ortho said that they are usually very conservative with their treatment estimates as they would rather have patients who are excited to finish early vs. bummed that treatment took longer.

Mine quoted me 9 months to a year and  Ill finish my refinements right at 18 months ‚NopeI understand your angle (i certainly don't like being short changed!) but I look at it like you are paying to have an end product - straight teeth. The time it takes to get there doesn't really come into it. It's not like paying a builder by the day.Well thank you. I wasnt aware that was all the cost was based on, in that case it clears things up for me.So, if your case came out more complex and took 24 months you'd be on board to pay more?\\n\\nOr would you argue that you paid for the result, regardless of how long it took?Listen. It was literally a question on how this was figured out, I am not an expert in the field clearly. I dont think I should be determining how orthodontists charge. It was literally a question to clear that up.\\n\\nIn my very limited understanding of this field, yes. Absolutely. If they explained up front that if my case takes longer than expected - there could be additional fees for taking additional time from the ortho - that sounds reasonable to me.You always pay per year sadlyI just had them remove my rubber band buttons because I didn't really need them and they were causing major issues with my mouth.

I also noticed that the invisalign pushes my upper lip out a bit, so the corners of my mouth are always spitty unless Im frequently cleaning it off - never had this issue before.

If you dont fix it now, it just gets worse\\n\\nHonestly its been a month for me and I still cant wait for it to be over but my teeth are in discomfort to begin with and once this is over I know I will feel better. But right now I have sores on my tongue. Gingival gel containing hyaluronic acid helps better than topical anaesthesia for meI change my trays every week, and just changed to my second tray last night. With the first tray, I felt very little pain. I have 15 attachments (was 16 but the one on the crown wouldnt stay) and while they bothered me at first, within a week they stopped being an issue. They do wear down and arent as sharp. I did use Oral B mouthwash for mouth sores and it seemed to help. I still have a very slight lisp. I notice it but others dont. \\n\\nWith the second tray, Im definitely in some more pain. I have very crowded bottom teeth and those ones are definitely in some pain, which I was expecting based on how the trays are laid out. My mouth has gotten used to the feeling of the aligners in so it doesnt really bother me much anymore. I used dental wax at first but now my tongue doesnt mind any slightly sharper than usual edges. Most people seem to say that the first week is the toughest, and then after that its just the tray changes that really suck, and at least for me, that seems to be true so far.Sensitive teeth is normal, at first tray I ate only soft food, was not able to chew anything at all. I hated everything about it, I am at 3rd with this one it is 1 month, my lisp is gone, I feel ok, got used to it but not totally, not hating anymore though. Every tray hurts different tooth so it will change how you feel, my teeth are also normally sensitive. But cutting tongue, I have never experienced it, I have elastics,  they tend to cut my cheeks. Hang in there , ask your ortho about cutting tongue, maybe they should do some modification on trays,  good luck.I was watching one YouTube video now, she says it was cutting her tongue so she used nail file to soften cutting edges. Amanda Bicket, how to make invisalign less painful.  Good luck!Just put on my 2nd tray ever 23 hours ago and I barely feel them except for on certain teeth. My 1st tray felt uncomfortable for at least the first 4-5 days. By day 6 they felt œloose\\x9d and by day 11 I woke up in the middle of the night because I thought I wasnt wearing them, thats how used to them I got.

I am 30 years old. Normal bite on the left, you can see the big gap when I close my incisors on the right! ThankyouIve seen Invisalign do some amazing things, but to know for sure youll want to do a consultation. Most are free, and I recommend going to a few places to get quotes. One bit of advice; think about how much you want to fix your overbite and be open to what the ortho recommends. Sometimes braces work better than Invisalign, and its not like Invisalign is actually invisible.It is partially cosmetic but mostly to try prevent stuff like sleep apnea. Thanks for the advice I would be happy with any solution. Wonder what Spain has on offer as I recently moved to MadridProbably. Look up some invisalign providers near you and go get you some free consultations.The X-rays will hold the answer- the only way youll know is to go to at least 3 different orthos for a free consultation. With sleep apnea already, you might need jaw surgery and braces/Invisalign. I wouldnt just accept the first answer you get because this looks like a pretty complicated caseYea.

My ortho recommended 4 day tray changes and eating/drinking with the trays in. Everything has went tremendously well. Never really had any significant pain and my teeth have always tracked well. I will eat anything with them in including carrots, nuts, crackers with no issues. The only thing I cant eat is food with turmeric or curry. After eating Ill take them out quickly to brush them and clean my teeth and put them back in. I havent had my trays out for more than 15 minutes in any day. The eating with them in along with using chewies at least an hour a day has really helped my teeth to track well. Judging by the looks of things I wont be needing any refinement trays. Im really happy with having 4 day tray changes as it has almost cut my treatment length in half compared to if I was on a week changes. I thought Id post this in case anyone elses ortho has recommended the same and they were wondering about it or maybe people may want to ask their ortho about this possibility. Happy to answer any questions anyone has.4 day tray changes sounds tempting but I dont like the idea of eating with them in –I accidentally did it once and it felt sooo wrongHow discolored are your trays after day 4?Not very at all. I take the treys out and clean them right away after eating.My dentist suggested the same thing and I was a bit sceptical. Maybe Ill give it a shot after all.My ortho did too but I dont like eating with trays in.Guys/girls please dont jump to a 4 day change time because you want to save time. Each plan is tailored to your needs. Over the course of my treatment Ive been on 2-14 days and that was set by the type and amount of movement done by each tray. Anyone on a shorter change time (< 7 days) is predefined by your provider with typically less motion occurring with each tray. Teeth need time to settle or you risk permanent damage to your teeth stability (look into periodontal ligaments).\\n\\nHaving a 4 or 7 day change cycle isnt œshortening\\x9d your overall treatment. Less motion with each tray typically involves more trays overall so its most a wash in terms of overall time. Personally I wish more providers went this route (nothing better than putting in a new tray that doesnt cause a lot of pain), but that is something to discuss with your provider, not randomly decide to do on your own.\\n\\nA good metaphor is you need to climb up to the second floor via a flight of stairs. Whats easier: A gradual ramp with a bunch of small steps, or several large steps? Youre getting to the same destination, but personally Id take the small steps all day long.....what? Invisalign trays are not made the with the pressure of eating, nor can your saliva circulate your teeth and gums to prevent plaque and bacteria build up with the trays in. Sugar, acid, and food debris will just sit stuck marinating your teeth and gums all day. It literally says right on the invis website to take them out when eating or drinking.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nThis seems like just begging for cavities, foul breath, and rancid trays. I\\'m questioning your doctor\\'s credibility to be quite honest.Hes a diamond provider. I take the trays out right after eating and brush them. Havent had any cavities and am done treatment in less than a week now.Just bc you happened to be lucky, doesn\\'t mean this doctor actually knows what he\\'s doing. If the trays were ok for eating and drinking, there would be no point in them being removable. There are specific instructions on the official Invisalign website that explicitly state they are NOT to be worn while eating or drinking. Sounds like this guy is rushing through your and other\\'s treatment to get those numbers up, which is likely how he made it to \"Diamond Provider\". Probably just trying to get a quicker turn around rate to get you in and out to make room for the next paying customer. Rushing through treatment leads to higher reversion rates, meaning you may be right back in his chair in a few years paying him again to fix your teeth, adding yet another number to his \"completed\" treatment list.\\n  \\n\\n  \\nQuantity does ***not*** always equal quality.Well they are removable so you can take them out to clean them and your teeth directly after eating. You havent provided any reason to not eat with them in other than food debris and bacteria build up. If you take them out and clean everything well right away that is not an issue and it certainly has never been an issue for me. I actually recently had my cleaning appointment at the dentist (different office completely) and they said that my teeth look great and I had very little plaque build up. Reversion is not an issue if you wear your retainers as you are supposed to. My teeth have been tracking amazingly and I certainly will not need any refinements. Also have not had any significant pain throughout treatment. I am very happy!How are the roots of your teeth?Great.

Would you be happier to see them drive a shitty banger?Not at all. 6k for orthodontic treatment is by far not the most expensive so stop acting like you just purchased a mansion. You got it right there - you paid for the TREATMENT. Not the over the counter extras. You dont need a case or chewies or an ortho key. They are OPTIONAL extras, not mandatory.

It shouldn\\'t have been a problem to give you an extra bit of plastic when you\\'ve already paid so much...Case isnt actually necessary for the treatment to be successful lol they should be in your face not your case. Its an optional extra.Have you asked them?I got a case and a chewie (which is just a piece of plastic) and a few cleaning crystal samples.Besides the standard box from Invisalign, I got three cases. Chewies. A few retainer brite packets. A nail file. Chap stick. Peroxyl sample.\\n\\nI bought my own ortho keys.Wow, 3 cases?  Were they the ones from Invisalign or some other brand?  Thanks for replying.Just generic plastic ones my orthodontist has. Nothing fancy lol.You can go thru your entire Invisalign journey without an ortho key and without those terrible chewies that cause TMJ and should be illegal lol \\n\\nCases are $12 on Amazon. One is enough to be honestNever heard anything about chewies and TMJ?Yeah, imagine chewing on something all day. It causes your jaw to tense up. Its terrible. Its like clenching all day.

Ive only ever been told to chew down for 20 seconds or soOther ppl in here chew on that shit all day ’Sort of serves them right then! So unnecessaryDid you get at least a case though?  After practically begging for a case we did end up buying another one from Amazon.   My wife has 10 attachments (12 at one point) on her teeth and according to her the Ortho Key really helped in removing her aligners.I did get a case, and a lil welcome bag. Thats wrong that her ortho didnt give her one \\n\\nOrtho keys are great!Something seriously wrong.  This is the same ortho that is using an aligner based on our last tray as a retainer.  Thanks again for replying.You mean the ortho didnt rescan your wife for retainers?Orthokey is up to you to buy.Yeah, we ended up buying some from Amazon.  Thanks for replying.It becomes easier to take them off without the help of them too.. best of luck in your wifes treatmentI\\'m doing my treatment through my dentist (and it\\'s been awesome). I got the little box with a case, cleaning crystals, and a pamphlet. Then my dentist gave me two more cases (cheap retainer cases that I actually like more than the Invisalign case) and all the chewies I could ever want. I had to buy my own removal key, but they\\'re pretty cheap, so it\\'s not a big deal.To be fair to anyone who didn\\'t get anything, they\\'re purely perks. The case is necessary to make sure your aligners are safely stored when not in use, but everything else isn\\'t standard. People clean them differently, some people don\\'t end up with rough edges, others bought an ortho key and never used it. When you get regular braces you don\\'t necessarily get any additional items, like wax or flossers. Or when you go to the doctor you don\\'t leave with a blood pressure cuff, which could be an actual necessity for some people. I don\\'t expect perks anywhere I go, I don\\'t review a restaurant poorly when I don\\'t get a free drink, but I\\'m certainly grateful and show my gratitude when I do get them. You definitely should have gotten a case, you were wronged there, but the rest of it isn\\'t a given.This. I disagree that the case is necessary. They should be in your face or being cleaned. The case isnt necessary for the treatment to work. OP and his wife need to pipe down and stop expecting optional extras that they didnt pay for. Entitled much? „Don\\'t think asking for something so basic is being entitled.  When you buy a pair of glasses you get a case.  When you buy contact lenses (the non-disposable kind) you get a case.  You buy dentures you get a case.  You\\'re right, a case has nothing to do with the treatment.  It has everything to do with protecting your product and common courtesy for the customer.I agree that it would be nice. But its not mandatory. A free glasses case is NICE, but sometimes you have to pay for your own. You dont kick off about something that is provided as an extra. Youre grateful and you say thank you if it does come, but you dont whine if it doesnt. \\n\\nI dont expect free drinks at a restaurant just because I have a high bill. Its nice, but I dont moan if I dont get anything. If I want a drink, Ill buy a drink. If you want a case, buy a case. You sound entitled because youre expecting things that you havent paid for. \\n\\nIf the customer wants to protect the product then they can buy a case. A new iPhone doesnt come with a case. Theyre thousands of dollars. You pay for the PRODUCT. If you want a case to protect the phone, you buy one. You dont go and whine to the Genius Bar because œasking for something to protect it is common courtesy\\x9d, because its not. \\n\\nIts not common courtesy at all. Providing the treatment to the best of your ability and being polite and open to any questions is the norm and thats what youre paying for. Treatment. Concerns to be answered. Reassurance. Professional Skill. Updates. Not freebies.  \\n\\nEXPECTING free extras, no matter how basic, is entitled behaviour.An aligner is a healthcare product that you put in your mouth that needs to be removed before you eat.  If any product needs a case its an aligner.  I\\'m not here to whine but to see what the general consensus is on how different clinics treat their customers.  So far, almost everyone here got a case without asking for one.The aligners should be in the mouth at all times and you put it in cleaning solution while you eat. IF you feel its more convenient for you to have access to a case, then you may go and purchase one. The product does not œneed\\x9d a case to work, therefore it doesnt need a case. It would be NICE if you got one, but you cannot expect something you havent paid for. Its very nice that other people get things, and if you want those optional things then you are more than welcome to go and see an ortho that will give those optional extras. If you want a Big Mac meal you go to McDonalds. But you dont go whine to Burger King because they dont offer the same. If your ortho doesnt offer optional extras then youve got no room to moan about it. You are moaning about it because youre trying to say that expecting free optional extras isnt entitled behaviour. Just because everyone else got it doesnt mean you get it. You cannot expect things that you do not pay for.Again, if you listened more than speak (you sound like the office manager from the ortho clinic) you would understand where I am coming from.  I am not moaning here.  I don\\'t even know what is included in a starter kit so that is why I am asking what everyone received.  If everybody got a case and my wife didn\\'t then how do you expect we will react?  Its called expectations.  When you buy a car you expect a steering wheel and hubcaps.  How are we supposed to know what to expect anyways when we never dealt with Invisalign before.Im order to drive a car you REQUIRE a steering wheel. That is NECESSARY. \\n\\nOptional extras are just that. Optional. You dont seem to be getting the point here. Youre saying that expecting things you dont pay for is not entitled behaviour. It literally is. You expect things that youre NOT entitled to.How the heck did we know what we are entitled to or not.  That\\'s why I created this thread.But youre sat there trying to say youre not acting entitled, talking about œcommon courtesy\\x9d and saying you œrequire\\x9d a case I really don\\'t see how I am acting entitled for asking for a basic item that everyone else received for free.  Looks like we may need to agree to disagree.  Not saying you\\'re wrong but our mindset is not the same.Acting entitled is expecting an item which you are not entitled to and have not paid for. Thats it.Just because everyone else received it doesnt mean you can go online and bash your orthodontists level of œcommon courtesy\\x9d (which could be harmful to their business if someone knew which ortho you went to!!) because they havent given you something they dont need to give to you.Going online and telling the public that my ortho don\\'t offer cases but the competitors down the street does is not bashing.  Its telling the truth and giving consumers more insight on who to go to for treatment.  You also keep repeating that we didn\\'t pay for a case.  Do you really need to put something so trivial down in your contract in order to receive one?  Come on.  Where is your business sense?My business sense is that you cant bash someone based on something that isnt supposed to be included. If you go to a Starbucks and then complain they didnt give you a free extra shot in your coffee thats still a negative thing that could affect their customer base and you cant do that. Stop acting like you deserve something just because you purchased a related product. Its entitled bs.I go by general consensus.  And the general consensus according to all the replies on here is that a case is INCLUDED.  This is called expectation not entitlement.But it doesnt SAY anywhere that the case is INCLUDED.  \\n\\nIf everyone on Reddit suddenly said yeah well the law says its okay to kill a man, that makes the general consensus œits okay to kill a man\\x9d. But youre still gonna be in prison. Thats just one example of how your reasoning is invalid. \\n\\nInvisalign does NOT include a case. Expecting something you have NOT paid for is entitled behaviour. You will NOT get very far with your ortho by arguing the toss over a plastic case. He handles your wifes orthodontia. He is very important. Respect him. Go buy a damn case theyre like $20 „If killing a man can save your family from getting slaughtered then it would be worth it even if it meant going to prison.  Its all about circumstances.  Already bought 2 cases from Amazon.  Not planning to bring this up with the ortho but the public has the right to know so they can do comparative shopping.  Being cheap with your customer is not the way to go when you have competitors breathing down your neck.But not offering extra freebies is not œbeing cheap\\x9d. You get what you pay for. The trays, the treatment, and the expertise. Not a plastic case. Youre unnecessarily damaging his reputation. I wouldnt want to have you as a patient ¬ you sound like a pain if Im honest. Running to trip advisor if the hotel is 1 minute too far from a restaurant „But youre comparing things that arent included you should write about the TREATMENT you received and the skill of the provider. Not the plastic case  its petty and expecting things you do not deserve is literally so entitled.Don\\'t get me started on the treatment.  What was supposed to be a 15 month treatment has now extended to over 37 months now.  The pandemic and Invisalign is 100% at fault for the delay according to the \"office manager\".  Yeah whatever.  Like I mentioned before putting down \"case included\" in your contract is very trivial and nobody does that.  When you pay thousands for treatment you expect a free case like everyone else.  Its not entitlement at all.  Any decent ortho would include a case.  I would if I was one.But thats nobodys fault? Why do you feel the need to blame everyone and everything else? Things happen. Yeah COVID was probably a massive part of it if Im honest. Youre trying to justify a delay for no reason. You seem highly unreasonable and petty. Delays happen. You arent entitled to anything you dont pay for. Just because œyoud do it if xyz\\x9d doesnt mean its possible in the real world. Just take the L about your choice of professional if thats how you feel, but complaining about it online is petty and entitled behaviour. Treatment is 9 times out of 10 extended for some reason. Whether thats teeth not moving or tracking, trays taking longer than expected, a world pandemic, illness the list goes on. Be less demanding and more understanding. It would go a LONG way. I reiterate, you sound like a nightmare unforgiving patient.Yeah, its never the orthodontist\\'s fault (sarcasm).  I understand that delays happen but when the delay is 22 months over the 15 months projected time something doesn\\'t seem right whether there is a pandemic or not.  People on here has started treatment with even more crooked teeth after my wife and have successfully completed their treatment already.  Meanwhile, my wife is still wearing her last tray for the last 2 months waiting for her next \"deactivated\" aligner (which is going to act as a retainer).  Her current tray is warped out of proportion too and pretty much useless but she\\'s wearing them anyways.  I think you need to know all the details before you call us a nightmare patient. youre just compounding my belief of nightmarishness. You mean a PASSIVE aligner btw. And trays can take up to 10 WEEKS to arrive. 2 months is less than that. Give them a chance ffs they need to come from Invisalign your poor ortho cant magic it to the office smh. \\n\\nOnly 22 months? Thats great. People have been quoted like 6 months and then 3.5 YEARS later, theyre finally done. Stfu these things take time. If you dont want to be patient, then just quit. \\n\\nEvery case is different and you cant compare your wifes case to others on here. Thats like rule number one. Your wife mightve had a serious bite issue, unstable roots, bone loss, gum problems, a connective tissue disorder etc etc. \\n\\nEveryones trays get loose and problematic whilst waiting for new trays. Youre not special. Stop trying to act like the main character  \\n\\nI want this I want that. Stfu. Let your professional be a professional. You sound absolutely immature, petty, childish, demanding, entitled and irritating. Change your attitude towards your poor orthodontist and give them a chance.Deactivated aligner were the ortho\\'s words not mine.  You\\'re giving rare examples and not the general consensus that most delays are anywhere between 6 to 9 months according to stats out there.  Of course everybody is different and since you don\\'t have over 3 years of details and over 10 changes to her treatment plan you shouldn\\'t be judging us.Im judging you purely off the way youre speaking about a trained professional. They have no reason to lie to you or extend your treatment. They want you out the door so they have room for another patient. \\n\\nRare examples? The majority of people have some form of gum recession. A LOT of people have problems with their teeth. Youre underestimating it dramatically. Again trying to act like the main character. \\n\\nChanges and rescans are absolutely normal. Extended treatment is absolutely normal. Stop acting like you deserve to be annoyed. There is nothing wrong here. In fact, the more changes to the treatment plan indicates that the teeth are not moving as expected, so its probable your wife has some kind of issue that the orthodontist cant get around. They just need to keep rescanning and do their best. Its not a cut and dry art form. It takes TIME. And youre so damn impatient for no reason „ \\n\\nI dont care how frustrating your experience has been, these delays are not your orthodontists fault. Hes clearly doing the best he can with this complex situation and here you are crying about the fact you didnt get a case that isnt even included  you have no reason to disrespect a professional like you are doing. Stop trying to blame everyone. These things literally happen and you need to be flexible and understanding. I defend my former point completely. You are entitled and demanding.There are bad seeds in every apple.  I trust my family dentist 100%.  The vibes she gives off is totally trustworthy leaving me content and satisfied with every single visit.  I wish I could say the same about our ortho.  Its not always about the treatment but how you approach problems and your customer service skills.  Ridiculous how you call us entitled and demanding when we are the ones who are paying thousands of dollars and not the other way around.But giving someone a freebie isnt œgood customer skills\\x9d  Lord Im starting to realise you may never actually understand the point. \\n\\nJust because you spent money does not entitle you to act like the queen ’ \\n\\nYou spent money on skills and treatment. That doesnt entitle you to things you DID NOT PAY FOR. And that doesnt entitle you to a smooth ride. Unforeseen changes happen and you dont get to act like a baby about it „ \\n\\nYoure paying for a treatment and results, its not about whether you agree to someones approach. Like it or not, you have to do it the way your professional says to. Thats why you hired a professional. If you didnt want to accept the problems and potential frustration that goes along with any kind of treatment then dont have the treatment. What you dont get to do is have the treatment and then badmouth an orthodontist because they didnt give you free things you arent entitled to. \\n\\nI absolutely stand by my point STILL that you are entitled and demanding patients. This is not the orthodontists fault. There is NOTHING they can do about wait times or treatment extensions. Cut them some slack. Your money does not entitle you to priority treatment. You are not the main character. You are literally a patient number. You honestly have a massive egotistical complex and you should get that taken care of. You are not as important as youre making yourself out to be. Be frickin humble. \\n\\nStop trying to say œwell I spent all this money\\x9d \\n\\nOkay?? We ALL spent a lot of money on treatment. Every single one of us. What makes you think you get to demand this and that? You arent a priority and you need to stop acting like a main character. Pipe tf down, respect your professional, and stop expecting things you do not deserve.I understand your points completely.  I just don\\'t agree with them.  You are also assuming that all orthodontists are ethical and honest but failed to realize that there can be bad seeds in every apple.  I\\'m done here with you because this conversation is going in circles and I don\\'t want the mods to close this thread.   Let\\'s agree to disagree.There can be a bad seed but youre holding things against your ortho that you cant hold against them. Youre trying to force your opinion onto your ortho and to me as well. I disagree entirely with your attitude and behaviour. Youre a petty nightmare patient.[deleted]Your provider is generous and thoughtful.  Thanks for replying.An ortho key really isnt necessary, you dont really need much other than a pouch to keep your trays in, a couple chewies and a travel toothbrush for when youre out. Youll also probably want an aligner brush and some cleaning tablets.It really depends on the person.  I had a horrible time taking my trays out the first week.  I bought a PulTool on Amazon and it helped dramatically!  It also cut down on the pain when removing my liners.  I still use it every time I take them out.  Ive been on Invisalign since February.Totally agree.  Some people have over a dozen attachments like my wife for instance.  Super hard to pull off using your bare fingers.

Maybe its miscommunication coming from them, like you dont need the attachments today, for the first tray, but theyll attach them in the future appointments?

Fast forward to night time, it was dinner and was removing my aligners. The bottom one didn't hurt but was a little uncomfortable, but when I tried removing my top aligner, it wouldn't budge and started panicking a little, I tried pulling a little harder and got it out on both sides of my molars, but it was still stuck on my upper front (got a few attachments on there, 13 in total). The gum on my left lateral incisor started bleeding and I got super freaked out by it. Nonetheless I got it out eventually. Ever since then, I've been so afraid to get my invisalign out for meal times. It sucks even more that I get so hungry between meal times but the thought of my bleeding gum still haunts me. Is it normal for it to bleed? Does it really get better after a week or 2?  \\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Got Invisalign yesterday. Started bleeding when taking it out for meal time. Super freaked out about it now everytime I gotta take it off to eat.It gets much easier to take off. Try pulling off from the œinside\\x9d side of your teeth. Ex. I personally cant pull my bottom trays off from my right side, I HAVE to do it from the left. Also pull away from the attachments so you dont rip them off. Check out orthokey on Amazon, it also helps. In short, I promise it gets easier and soon youll be pulling them off and putting them in without a mirrorThis is the way.I'm on day 5, and it's already so much easier - I had a couple of panicked removals in my first couple of day too and was horrified, but I'm a lot more comfortable with it now.Get a Pul tool or Orthokey as others have mentioned. Once you wear the tray for a bit they will soften as well and become easier to move.Along with the ortho key and pulling from the inside at the back, I found that once everything was loose on the back teeth it helped to actually hold the aligner steady on my front two teeth with one hand (using my thumb to basically push on it to keep it on, which seems counterintuitive, I know) and then gently pulling down with the other hand to slowly remove, from the left, off my canine then incisor and slowly relieving pressure (from my thumb holding it firm) off my left central incisor (but not entirely, so you still have control over how much yanking the aligner hooked to the attachment is doing) and kind of pulling the aligner forward to pop it off the attachment. You may need to jiggle it a little, trying to pull it forward and up and down a little to dislodge it from the attachment. \\n\\nBasically, put your thumb under your two front teeth to control how much pulling is happening to your teeth vs. the aligner. Let the aligner take the force. Kind of like when you're taking a bandaid off and you hold down on your skin so you aren't also pulling your skin upward, leaving the majority of the force on the bandaid.\\n\\nAfter the first week or two it'll become less sore and will feel easier because it no longer feels like you're ripping your teeth out with the aligner.I'm surprised people are having to recommend the orthokey...I assumed those were given out  with the aligners like at my place.  In fact, they had me go over to a mirror and practice using it to remove the aligners right away until I got the hang of it. \\n\\nYou definitely need a pull device, especially if you clip/bite down your fingernails super short like me.I mean, they had me practice with my fingers in front of them.I was surprised my ortho didnt have me practice removing at the fitting and assumed itd be fairly easy to take out and I was being paranoid.\\n\\nI was wrong (at first). It seems unfortunately a number of us have to suffer the first time and then learn our best method.\\n\\nAlso kinda shit neither Invisalign nor practitioners seem to explain removing from the inside (assuming attachments are outside) is by far the easiest way to do it so that you arent tugging the attachments.\\n\\nOwell, we all get there in the end\", 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'financial concerns', 'facial appearance', 'oral hygiene', 'tray time management', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction'], 'scores': [0.23499134182929993, 0.2032705396413803, 0.13454310595989227, 0.128498837351799, 0.1032213643193245, 0.0984918549656868, 0.09698289632797241]}, {'sequence': 'Ortho said not a good candidate for InvisalignGet a second opinion.

Idk ·You are most likely a borerline surgical open bite. You wouldnt be able to tell from just those photos but your comments from the ortho give credence to this.  \\n\\nIf you go to an experienced invisalign ortho they would tell you they prefer to treat this type of case with aligners over braces due to the biomechanics involved.  The comprimise if any would be if your passed on the surgery.  But the ortho part can and probably should be treated with aligners.   Get a second opinion and pick someone experienced with Invisalign.Ya you\\'re probably right. So basically what you\\'re saying is it  just depends what the Ortho is good at? Or do you really think invis would do a better job at treating my case? \\n\\n I\\'m going to schedule an appt with a \"diamond pro\" individual I found off Invisalign site. They should be able to help alsoYes exactly. Aligners and braces are two different modalities.   They work differently to move teeth.  Both are extremely technique sensitive.  So treatment plan recommendations\\nwill be based on doctor experience and comfort.  Which is why you will get a variety of opinions on this.  \\n\\nAn experienced Ortho that treats with invisalign will understand how to use aligner strenghts to treat your type of case.  If you are truly an open bite that is borderline surgical, there is evidence based literature that support Aligner usage in these type of situations. Not only with closing  the open bite but also long term stability compared to braces.  There are numerous articles in the journals of cases just like yours . I wouldnt be surprised if you get the opposite recommendation ( that they prefer invisalign over braces ) for the above reasons.  \\n\\nYour next step is wise.  Just make sure it is an ortho and not a GP.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind. Photos are just photos.  Doctors use xrays and in mouth observation to diagnosis.  There may be more to your story but like i said your comments from the ortho and your Gp give credence to the fact that you have an openbite that is borderline surgical which means there is a skeletal component.  A treament plan that will mask the skeletal the best they can is what they are aiming for.Thank you \\x8fOrtho said no liners due to minor open bite.. should I go to someone else?

I think that may be why this Ortho prefers to do braces as well. He said \"we can\\'t to 100 percent, but we can get closer to it using braces than Invisalign\" and maybe he\\'s got a pointthank you and its okay i think itll go away overtime! but yeah i def think ur ortho has  a point just because with braces i feel like your jaw would be more relaxed bc u dont have plastic trays in ur mouth. and with invisaligns youre constantly taking them out to eat and drink vs braces your teeth are just always moving. just do ur research and u should be okay!! good luck with whatever you choose :)Baloney. Onto the next orthodontic consultation. Third time hopefully the charm. Your preference on Invisalign vs braces is one of the most important parts of your treatment plan. Sure its the doctors job and due diligence to let you know what his opinion is on which treatment method hed deem most successful but Ive seen miraculous work done with clear aligners and its surprising he told you youre not a good candidate IMO. Obviously not everyone can have success with Invisalign, but Ive seen wack teeth (I work for a dentist) get turned way around with Invisalign. Dont give up :)Get a 2nd opinionI was told braces would get me a better result too. I chose Invisalign as I didnt want regular braces. My treatment will be 18 months, Im 5 months in.

Worst worst cases then this that was solved by Invisalign. Go to different OrthoHonestly just do the braces. Itll be over before you know it. From someone who has ceramics get the metal. They will look better. Would you rather it be done right and have a better result and maybe be uncomfortable with how you look for a couple years or end up being in Invisalign longer with not the best results. Itll be okay!I think you may be right!Itll go by fast and you will like the end result. Also I feel like i personally would get annoyed with having to take the trays out any time I wanted to eat/drink something thats not waterHes lyingGet multiple opinions. I had a orthodontist recommend regular braces for two years. Saw two more who gave me similar quotes for Invisalign. Went with the one I had the best gut feeling with and I am here now with Invisalign in my teeth. \\n\\nI think some orthodontists are more skilled with Invisalign than others. The one who told me braces only it appeared his practice was very geared toward braces vs Invisalign so it would make sense why he was more comfortable putting me in braces.That\\'s the same with this provider It seems. I\\'m not mad at him about it, at least he\\'s being honestGet a second opinion.  So far, Invisalign has fixed my crowding, my open bite, and my overjet.

Its easier for me to do this because i WFH, i dont really go out ever.. my hobbies are mostly indoor ones so i rarely if ever leave my house. Its easy to follow the rules when 'normal life' isn't getting in the way. \\n\\nMy ortho hasnt mentioned anything about refinements for my case as of yet, i guess we will see when i get to the end but im tracking great, no issues, and he originally quoted me 18 months to 2 years so i doubt ill really be 'done' in 14 weeks but who knows?  \\n\\nIm thrilled with my progress. I look at this photo and i cant believe its my teeth!  They are my teeth :DHas OMAD helped you with weight loss?Yeah definitely, it takes some getting used too. Im absolutely a grazer, its just how i like to eat and naturally gravitate towards it but once i adjusted it becomes fairly easy. \\n\\nInvisalign has helped with OMAD. I made the resolution to keep my trays in as much as possible and perform as close to perfect dental hygiene as possible, so taking them out, eating, brushing flossing, cleaning the trays and putting them back in is a whole process and i just dont want to do it that often, so.. OMAD came about. I cant even eat too much in one sitting so i generally eat between 1200-1500 cal meal, with a starter, main and dessert type food in it. \\n\\nIm 160cm / 5ft3 and inactive right now, so this is fine for me. If youre going to do it, make sure you know how many calories youre eating so youre not eating too little. Its surprisingly easy to do with OMAD, especially if youre eating veggies and low calorie foods in general. Last thing you want it to crash and fall off because youre eating too little!Thanks!

May I know if you had any extractions? My teeth is similar to yours and will be extracting two teeth tomorrow and Im super nervous about it!!¶Yes i had 2 extractions, both upper canines and about 2 weeks into my Invisalign treatment. I wont lie to you, immediately after they were taken out and i saw myself my very first thought was 'what have i done' and i HATED it. absolutely hated it. \\n\\nI thought it would never leave the house again. \\n\\nBut it got better, they *needed* to come out to make room for the rest. I know a lot of people are completely against extractions, but i *know* in my case i have very big teeth, a very little mouth, and there was just *no way* they were going to be straight otherwise. \\n\\nI **trust** my dentist and my orthodontist and i cant stress enough how much this puts my mind at ease. They are good, intelligent men who have worked with me to get me here, and i trust that they know what they are doing and wouldnt steer me wrong. I just have to do my part :) \\n\\nYou will hate it immediately after, too i would bet money on it. **Trust the process**, *it gets better!*Thank you for your kind words and seeing your experience really help calms me down! I just got my extractions done and will be receiving my first set of aligners next Tuesday! Hopefully all go well and really looking forward to it!Are you absolutely sure you want and need the ectractions?   I had them - and needed to reverse afterwards as the retrsction was too much. \\n\\nIt worke best with people who have very big teeth and signifucant crowding. I had neither and now have spent 30000 dollars to reverse and get implants -- for health problems that resulted years later.I wasnt sure! Thats why its so nerve-wrecking. I went to 3 different orthodontist for consultation since I was so scared of extractions, and all 3 of them came up with the same recommendations. My mouth space is too crowded with the bottom front teeth basically laying on top of each other. \\x8f» fingers crossed and hope all will go well. Just gotta trust the process I guess!What country are you in?  In some countries orthos do not know how to treat cases like yours except with extractions.  Does not mean it is a good idea. \\n\\nSurprised no one mentioned expansiom to you.  Your arches look small. \\n\\nI do not believe in the concept 'trust the process' in a field where there have been so many damaged patients.  ' Do your own research' is more prudent. \\n\\n https://link.medium.com/pA98sIUKAobIm from Singapore.. I get what you mean However, my upper teeth was naturally missing two premolars and hence without removing the bottom 2 premolars, the bite will never be normal. I have been suffering from TMJ for more than 10 years now so the treatment plans the orthodontists proposed seem to make sense, but still just so.. nerve-wrecking, sigh. Hopefully all will turn out well That final after is going to be awesome!!!Good job! We can do this!   \\nIts not that hard to floss, brush and rinse the trays after each meal if you think of it, its a good habit.I have gone out a few times to the pub or a meal or whatever and brushed my teeth in the bathroom, i have no shame in it. I have braces, i need to brush my teeth. If i have to do that in a public bathroom then so be it! Most people dont bat an eye. Retainers, Invisalign, even braces themselves arent uncommon anymore. Ive had people ask and then they are nothing but supportive. No ones ever treated me badly or made any comment that makes me insecure about it :)well done mateWow. Giving me hope! They look great so far. Good job!Love seeing your progress.Woah amazing progress!! Wishing you luck for the next 14 weeks+Looks great! If you paid for comprehensive, go for the refinements. Get them as perfect as you can, Â6000 is a large chunk!That is amazing! did you have any bite problems?Yep, cross bite! There was basically no alignment anywhere with my teeth. Invisalign is truly magic :D My Ortho did say i could benefit from surgery, but i opted against it since i couldnt take that much time off work for recovery and still be able to afford the treatment. \\n\\nMost of the first 20 weeks was widening and straightening my back teeth, and it happened SO quickly. There is widening and moving of the back teeth all the way to the end as well but the bulk of the movement back there was in the beginning. Before i started i had indents in my tongue all the way around from my teeth sitting on my tongue because there just wasnt room for it. Now i have none :) \\n\\nIts a good feeling!This is fab work, friend.WOW!!  Just WOW. Amazing progress.Wow, amazing progress.  Have you noticed a significant change in your face shape? Im certainly no ortho/dentist, but I wouldnt have guess this was even fixable without surgeryMy mum says my face is more symmetrical now. I cant say ive noticed but then i didnt really notice the teeth moving as much as they have because its my face / mouth, i look at it every day :D \\n\\nBut others have so.. yes?Did you have two layers of front teeth beforeNo, not in the sense of 'two sets of teeth'. I have one set of teeth like everyone else, there just wasn't space for them all to come through where they should have. Sure looks like it though didn't it?

The other charged nothing and spoke with me for a good 15 minutes, quoting me $5k with a discount if I paid up front.Good call out - i just went to ortho clinics that had free consultations and chose to avoid those that charged a fee.I suspect the lack of competition is what gave that particular clinic the ability to gouge on what really should be a free service.Yep!

I have them myself and theres a lot more to it than youd think.Genuinely curious, why would you opt for Invisalign over traditional braces for a 12 year old?He had braces during phase 1 after he had an expander and hated them. The orthodontist was supportive of his desire to do aligners. I had traditional braces and hated them. I still have scars inside my mouth so since the ortho supported we went with it.As far as hygiene goes it's not especially difficult. He takes them out, eats, brushes his teeth and puts them back on. Putting them on without brushing is not a good idea and should be avoided as much as possible, otherwise he risks cavities. Flossing is very important, at least once a day before bed. A portable kit consisting of a brush and toothpaste and some floss is a must, as well as an aligner case to put them in when he's not wearing them.\\n\\nThat being said, he is only 12 years old and aligners might be a challenge for him. If you want to put anything but water in your mouth they should be taken out, and ideally you need to brush afterwards. Ideal daily wear is 20-22 hours, but wearing them less than 20 hours a day should be avoided as much as possible. Aligners take a lot of discipline even for adults, let alone a kid.\\n\\nGood luck!\\n\\nEdit to add: an ortho key is apparently a handy tool for taking them out, although I've never used it. There's also chewies which are bits of gum really that you chew on to seat the aligners, but I don't use those either. I don't find them to be essential. If I feel like I need to seat my aligners better I just bite on some cotton rounds a few times.Hi! Youve already gotten some good advice here but I wanted to jump on to offer encouragement. My 11 year old and 13 year old are both doing Invisalign right now. They are around the half way mark and weve had no issues. No problems getting them to wear them, no one has lost them or accidentally thrown them out and their orthodontist is very pleased with the progress. I found it next to impossible to find stories from other parents whos kids were doing Invisalign and a lot of comments saying it was a mistake not doing braces. It was initially discouraging but after the feedback from their ortho I know theyre doing great.\\n\\nWe get the kids to brush their teeth AND aligners every time they eat at home. If they are at school or a friends house, they are to rinse their mouth and the aligners with water. Once a week we use a retainer cleaning tab in an ultrasonic cleaner to get them nice and fresh again. \\n\\nAn ortho key was very helpful in the weeks following their attachments being put on.

Should I just get the pocket reduction done or is it worth my time and money to seek out a second opinion?I'm currently mid treatment, and have been on hold for the last 6 months with 6-8 more weeks to go because I had to have this exact issue resolved.\\n\\n\\nI'm no industry professional, but personal experience, get it done before starting because it'll only get worse.How deep were your pockets before, and how much worse did Invisalign make them?I don't know, to be honest.  Other than there were zero concerns when I started, and then it was full stop until it got taken care of once I was 2 years in.\\n\\nI have massive dental anxiety, so my brain kinda just shuts off when the details start.I actually work for a periodontist. In general its best to make sure your teeth and gums are as healthy as possible before doing ortho. You want your pockets to be 4 or under. Once you start getting deeper pockets it can lead to bone loss and eventually losing your teeth. By œpocket reduction\\x9d do you mean a deep cleaning (scaling and root planing)? Or an actual surgery?She called it an osseuss surgery, so the Perio will have to open the gum flap and clean under their for 2 quadrants.Ah I see. Thats typically the next step after youve had a deep cleaning if your pocket depth didnt improve. At my office we only do that with more aggressive perio, like 7-8mm or higher. You could try seeing if they would just let you do another deep cleaning, but most insurances only cover it once every 3 years or so. That could also be why they suggested osseous; trying to get the most out of your insurance. \\n\\nWant to add too that the surgery usually has pretty good result! Our patients normally have improved pocket depths afterward.My pocket depths generally improved after I had my wisdom teeth taken out. I had them taken out in April, and the deepest pocket went from 8 mm in December to 6 mm today. Do you think itd be worth holding out another month or so and seeing if the improvement continues?Unfortunately you probably wont see much more improvement. Once they are that deep its impossible to clean them on your own even with great home care because its under your gums.

I am just curious why you all got Invisalign or why youre considering Invisalign? If you already had it, how has it impacted your life? Any upsides? Downsides?

Really want to retrain as a nurse but knew i wouldn\\'t want to smile when talking to patients and i wouldn\\'t come across well. I really feel like my teeth have held me back, but since having invisalign and being close to the finish line, i laugh more, smile more, chat more animatedly, it\\'s like the real me has finally been able to shine, it really has changed me so much.That is amazing! I love that its helped you live life to the fullest[deleted]Love the honesty! Thank you!I\\'m on 33/40. My overbite has bothered me for years and then crowding bottom teeth and an upcoming wedding pushed me into it. Wish I had sooner. Got me to do intermittent fasting again too so as much as I hate snacking less (and I don\\'t think I lost weight from it specifically since I\\'m also eating better, hard to know), it\\'s a net positive so far! Willing to get my assumed refinement trays, however many that may be.That is awesome! Thank you!I had braces over 15 years ago. Finished early and had gaps filled with bonding. After removing wisdom teeth, retainers wouldnt fit so everything shifted. I absolutely cannot stand the bonding any longer so Im getting Invisalign to fix gaps on top, fix crowding on bottom and fix a deep bite.Makes total sense!! And itll be a lot quicker I hopeI hadnt realised quite how bad my bottom teeth were until two years of working on Zoom calls all day.  I became so self conscious and started to just feel worse and worse about myself.  Am so glad Ive started.  Am five trays in and Im just starting to see the changes.This happened to me as well. Always knew I had crowding I wanted fixed but seeing it daily on camera really solidified that desire.Another weird Covid side effect?! LolI decided to do invisalign because my teeth were not straight and I wanted them straightened out (mostly first front teeth top and bottom). They werent that bad but it was enough to bother me. Im about to be done and I feel so much more confident. I truely recommend it!Love it! Thank you!I am just getting started (tray 3/28) but I am so happy Im finally doing this at age 41. My teeth always looked nice and straight, but I have always had a really messed up bite (posterior cross bite and anterior open bite) and over time it was doing lots of damage to my teeth. Cracking, gum recession, etc. Even in these early days of Invisalign, the benefit is really obvious to me. I used to always have random tooth and jaw pain that I just learned to live with, but now I dont have pain anymore! Its fantastic and Im so happy Im finally doing it.Its so good that you knew that! Did your dentist/ortho explain that or you just knew?I didnt really know. The dentist I had for basically my whole adult life never mentioned it to me. Then I switched to new dentist, and at the first appointment he was like, whoa, awful bite you got there. So he referred me to an orthodontist who confirmed it and got me going with the Invisalign. Very thankful for the new dentist.Had braces as a kid, didn\\'t wear retainer, teeth shifted. I have a gap that\\'s getting worse between the central and lateral incisor, and my lip gets caught in it occasionally (not a major problem but still bothersome). I also have a pretty significant overjet on one side, and it\\'s causing unevenness of my bottom lip as it is getting \"sucked in\" to fill that space. My teeth are actually pretty straight, other than the one central incisor that is \"flaring\" out and creating the gaps.  Hopefully that explanation makes sense.  I\\'m 2 weeks in.Totally understandable !! Thank you for your input its super helpfulI was always teased for my teeth - big front teeth with a big gap and deep bite that made my smile awkward. So I always wanted them fixed. My parents couldnt afford braces for me as a kid but we have poor gum health and my teeth were crowding which caused gum recession and a crack in a tooth as I aged. Im mostly over being self conscious about it but now Im worried about dental health. I recently got a promotion with dental insurance so I was like screw it may as well get Invisalign before things get worse. \\n\\nIm 6 weeks (6/51 trays) in and so far it hasnt been too bad. Theyre not that noticeable even with a lot of attachments. Biggest downside for me is just setting aside the time to eat or have sugary drinks because I find myself avoiding the hassle of popping them out, eating, and brushing my teeth again. Some people are pretty lax about that part without issue but I hate putting trays on my unbrushed teeth so I try and stick to the routine. Otherwise so far its been good.Congrats on the promotion! Thats wonderfulI had braces as a kid, when I got retainer it was badly made and cut into my gums making them always swollen so I stopped wearing, when I realised my teeth moved I opted for another retainer but my teeth had already moved by then. I thought if im wearing a retainer every night anyway might as well get invisilign to fix it as my front teeth slightly protruded again and then I can wear new retainer to keep my straight teeth. I also have overjet but it doesnt really concern me and I havent had any problems, they say to extract wisdom teeth to fix it fully but my wisdom teeth are healthy and came out normally so I dont want to, but Invisalign will help make it smaller. I just want my teeth to be straight so Im not scared of people seeing my teeth when I eat/smile .\\n\\nFor me I didnt feel any major pain or have any lisp or anything it just feels like wearing a retainer 24/7 , I guess the only way it changed my life is that I have to schedule when I want to eat things rather than eating whenever , also the elastics I had to get used to especially when I yawn I have to try and not open my mouth too wide lolI get that!! Wearing a retainer as a kid would be hard lol do the elastics ever break?Nope! Though I have to remember to keep the bag on me at all times because sometimes they just fling to who knows where when I try to put them back on hahaI had braces at 20 and my teeth were perfect for years after that. I lost my retainer about 10 years later and my teeth slowly shifted back to their original (crooked) positions and I was mortified after seeing pics of myself. I also stopped smiling with teeth and then made the decision to get Invisalign. 17 trays later and my teeth are even better than after braces! One more tray to go and Ill be done. I cant stop smiling now :)Yaaaay that is awesome!!! Its so crazy that teeth  remember where they want to be ‚I am due to collect my first trays in 11 days time, aged 55. I couldnt afford it before now. In the U.K., I had a horrible dental plate with elastics on them that was meant to straighten my teeth, but didnt. I was not offered any form of retainer or anything. Others dont think my teeth are bad, and it doesnt stop me from smiling, but it bothers me. I find it hard to clean them properly especially behind the front teeth. Im so looking forward to seeing the changes Invisalign will make.Im excited for you!! What do you clean the aligners with?I have no idea yet, I dont collect my first trays for another 11 days. Hoping Ill be given lots of information from my orthodontist.[deleted]Love that!!I had straight teeth. I got it to fix my deep bite, which doesnt really bother me because you cant see it when I smile. It will help the health of my bottom front teeth (one of them has chipped because of my bite so thats why I got it. I definitely dont like how visible Invisalign is, I have an attachment on pretty much every tooth.. and its way more expensive and taking longer than I thought. But I think by the end itll feel worth doing.Do people tell you they notice the aligners a lot?The people Im very close to tell me they are super noticeable but random people dont just come up and tell me they can see my Invisalign hahaReason I got Invisalign: vanity. Since COVID, I get to see my face constantly on zoom and it has inspired an odyssey of cosmetic improvements to my face, including my teeth. \\n\\nUpside: straight teeth\\n\\nDownside: the process isnt instant gratification; but its not bad. Worth it.Fair enough!! Nothing worth doing is instant gratification I guess lolI had Invisalign for about 3 years. Finished about 5 years ago. I started at age 32, finished age 35. When my wisdom teeth came in during my late 20\\'s, they really messed up my teeth, making them very crooked, and I started feeling self conscious about it. So I got the wisdom teeth removed then got Invisalign. Yeah it was hard those first few months, but I got used to them and it was like whatever. Now they\\'re done and I still say it\\'s the best decision I\\'ve ever made in my entire life. So glad I did it. I love my smile now, and I cheese it up for the cameras all the time now. Even now I look at some old photos of me and I\\'m like, OMG! These crooked teeth! I didn\\'t even realize what a difference it made!Those darned wisdom teeth! Lol I had my bottoms removed but not my top. Im in my early 20s so I wonder if I should be worried about thatIt\\'s definitely not uncommon, I don\\'t think. And it probably depends on the individual. Mine just came in in such a way that they pointed forward toward my other teeth instead of down and out. They were impacted and shoving all my teeth together. I guess if you already have them, you might consider them moving but if you don\\'t have them, maybe don\\'t worry about it yet.I got it because I had a unilateral overbite + it was free :)Howd you score that?! Lol thats awesome that it was freeIm studying orthodontics and our program director did some sort of agreement with Invisalign and they gave each resident two free cases. Naturally, I did it on myself ‚Had braces as a teen, never wore retainers so teeth drifted a lot. Fast forward a couple of years and I was never happy with my smile, by chance a coworker mentioned they wanted to get invisalign because they weren\\'t happy with their smile and I thought to myself \"hold on a sec, I\\'m not happy with my smile so maybe I should check it out?\" And here I am almost done hopefully! ƒYay! Love that!Im straightening my teeth to make room for some dental implants. When I was a child it was cheaper to pull out a tooth with a cavity than it was to fill it. Im missing 3 molars on the bottom. Over time, my top teeth have dropped into the spaces where I have missing molars. Im 18 months into Invisalign now and so happy so far with the treatment. Im 68 and have a lot of regret that I waited so long. Getting close to having my implants done \\x81Woohoo!! That is awesome!I had a very small crossbite that I honestly didnt even know about. But I was accidentally biting my lip when I ate sometimes. It would get infected and turn into a canker, get really swollen and then I would continue to bite it for days when eating. Had slowly gotten worse over the past 10 years so I assume my teeth were shifting slightly. My hygienist said the best way to fix it would be Invisalign. \\n\\n9 months in and havent bitten my lip since I started.Yay for no lip biting!I\\'m 38 years old and never had braces. I\\'ve been self conscious about my teeth for years. Ill have Invisalign for 18 months and I just had some surgery to widen my arch. Very expensive (and im pretty sore at the moment) but this is my 40th birthday present to myself.Aww happy birthday! Itll be worth it, hang in there!Im now 66 and had braces when I was 33-34 to fix my Bugs Bunny teeth. My parents couldnt afford it when I was a teenager.  I didnt wear the retainer for long because I stupidly thought my teeth would stay beautiful and straight.  Now 30 years later, the top ones are pretty good except for a gap which has appeared in the last couple of years, but the bottom ones are all crowded again. Ive been noticing when watching TV and also talking to a lot of (older) people, that you can see their bottom teeth more than the top ones when they talk. I wanted to get my bottom teeth straightened before that happens to me, but apparently you need both top and bottom done at the same time. I guess the top lip drops (as has everything else on my body!) as you age.  Im now on tray 2 of 29 with weekly changes, plus refinements, so probably 35 all up. My next door neighbour who is 49 also decided to have Invisalign so we go to the same dentist and started on the same day. Its good to have someone to share the experience with. Tray 1 was just a œtraining\\x9d set according to the dentist, but 2 days ago I had a bunch of attachments and not liking the way they look but I guess Ill get used to it.  I should be finished by the end of 2022.That is so cool! Its great to have someone to share all the experiences with[deleted]Oh my gosh, that breaks my heart!!I never had braces as a child and when my wisdom teeth started growing out (when I was a teen) my teeth slowly started crowding. The crowding stopped when I removed wisdom teeth, but teeth stayed in that position. They were pretty OK (everyone tells me that I didn\\'t need Invisalign), but there were 2 areas that really bothered me. First were top central incisors that are slightly crossing (this bothers me on every picture I take as I always smile showing teeth and it bothered me for a long time). Second were all four bottom incisors that were like a fan and really hard to clean.\\n\\nThe second issue is almost solved (aside for one stubborn teeth that didn\\'t want to follow completely and is waiting second round) and the first takes so long I am slowly losing motivation. First all back teeth must moved and then after tray 25 or when (I was checking trays in packages that I have at home), they will start slowly straightening. Then if I will have black triangle between them, I will ask for IPR or something to solve it - we will see in few months.\\n\\nAside of that ortho said I have an open bite, so we are solving this as well ·\\x8dï¸\\x8f\\n\\nI miss snacks, especially while watching movies or series. I miss that even if I want one bite of chocolate or icecream, I need to go through this long procedure of cleaning. Sometimes I do regardless of that. I bet in one year I will forget about it, but now I am not really as motivated as I was in the beginning. It is like between trays 15 and 25 nothing is happening. All I do is wait for these back teeth to move and it is no fun.\\n\\nThe main upside is the oral hygiene. Brushing teeth four times per day ensures that I don\\'t even get any tooth stone (before I had to go to cleaning quite regularly) and straight teeth once in the near future of course …Could be a good weight loss plan ‚‚ that is awesome!Yes, totally.

Imagine breaking your leg and then being sent a DIY plaster cast kit through the mail. With SDC you take the moulds of your teeth yourself and do not undergo rigorous examinations (X-rays etc) to check the health of your teeth first. If your teeth arent healthy and you start trying to move them without direct supervision of a dentist/ortho you could lose a tooth. Also Ive heard that SDC doesnt really take into consideration your bite in the final result.Yea all of this.\\nEspecially the fact that because you don't see a specialist with SDC there cannot be any attachments or things added to your teeth to make those more complicated movements possible that invisalign can easily fix.Invisalign 100%. It's more expensive, but totally worth it. Go to an orthodontist, NOT a dentist. So many horror stories about smile direct club or dentists doing invisalign. Go to reputable orthodontists for consultations (consults are free!) go to someone you trust, you feel comfortable talking to, and confident in their abilities. Get on a payment plan or save up to do it right. Some insurance covers Invisalign-- so look into that too. my Invisalign costs $200 per month interest free. Worth every penny. Good luck!Seconding go to an orthodontist and not a dentist. Costs the same either way, so you might as well go with an expert. Invisalign has a directory on their website of providers that shows tiers based on how many cases they have done. (Again, price shouldnt vary, so go with a diamond provider.)Just to balance out the feedback here ” I got mine at my normal dentist and I am super happy! That said, I did a TON of research into the dentists before choosing them in the first place ” I knew I'd eventually want invisalign once I could afford it ” and part of why I chose them was reading reviews online from folks who got invisalign there. They're also certified by invisalign, or whatever that system is technically called.\\n\\nSo basically the above commenters ARE usually right, but bear in mind that there *are* also highly trained & educated general dentists who can provide you with good care!Wait. I'm going to a dentist not Ortho. I just started (tray 1). I didn't shop around because anxiety. And I've been waiting for years to move forward with this. Am I screwed? Can I get a second opinion mid-treatment?I didnt mean to imply ALL dentists are œbad\\x9d providers, Im just of the opinion that orthodontists are often better providers since they spend their entire schooling learning how to move teeth/correct bites. Plenty of folks are happy with/have great results with dentists. As long as you are happy with them there is no reason to switch. You can look them up in the directory on the Invisalign to see their œrank\\x9d which will give you an idea of how many cases they have done. They may have done just as many cases as an orthodontist. Dont overthink it (unless you actually become unhappy with them, in which case I do believe you can transfer your case).Lol youre fine. Mine was a dentist. Not a biggie.I use Invisalign, I am an engineer, and I look into both pretty deeply. What you were getting with Invisalign is a more customized, even bespoke, experience. It requires the time of an expert, their modeling software is incredible, how they take the sensing data and make it into a 3D model is nothing short of magic even though I know exactly how it works and I literally have a graduate degree and do similar things in a different area professionally - yeah they just stuck a camera in my mouth and although the sudden I have this little video that shows with my teeth are going to do?

I just ate breakfast with absolutely no issues and my teeth just went where they were supposed to. To get here involved precision grinding of the gaps between my teeth, a plan that look like it took a lot of thinking to make, and really precise instructions from my orthodontist who I have called at strange hours to ask questions and they answer them.\\n\\nMaybe smile direct is similar but from my research it just seems that they have much lower precision.Thanks for the help guys im pretty sure i know now what one not to get‚‘\\x8d\\x8f½Go with Invisalign. The results are more reliable and its safer for your teeth. Lots of people who get the online knockoffs end up having to pay for Invisalign in the end because the other versions cant make the movements they need or end up screwing up their teeth.

I saw in one of the support groups where someone who was doing invisalign started to feel a hard knot on their gum, and an x-ray showed that they had an odd shaped root that was being moved to the surface by the movement of the tooth. They had to stop treatment and move the teeth back. And a lot of people end up with an open bite at the end that needs to be fixed. I think of it kind of like bleaching your hair at home. If everything goes great then it's a great savings. But if anything goes wrong then your out the money you spent and you have to pay to fix it.

I had extractions over 12 years ago for my teeth but mine are much much bigger and we tried to not extract first. Im in my second round now due to them not extracting first as my smile is now sticking out from it trying to force the teeth to fit. However, I dont see your teeth as needing that since they have many options to widen your smile and fit all the teeth.  Im not a dentist but I think the trays look fine and they are widening to avoid your teeth moving backwards. A lot of orthos tend to go with extraction from my experience. I had consults with 5 as a teen and only one said we could keep them which didnt end up working anyway, I think you are asking all the right questions in your situation and I hope you feel like you can trust this one!The first orthodontist I went to wanted to extract 3 teeth and start Invisalign the next day. I said he was crazy and I wasnt doing that. He scolded me saying it was the only thing that would work with my mouth and sure enough I left and got a second opinion. She told me absolutely not, we are extracting anything and that they can do IPR to help. Which is totally less invasive. \\n\\nThe good thing with Invisalign is if you have a comprehensive plan, you can always do refinements until you are happy with the outcome. It also will move your teeth at a slower rate but more precise since it can target specific teeth. Braces cannot target a single tooth.Hi, so glad you found a new option, and a safer option.  Ok: here is what I see---but note I am not an orthodontist:\\n\\nThe arches seem to be wider in the 14th tray.    In terms of length, the arches  seem to be about the same, or the 14th tray just \"slightly\" retracted:  I cannot tell for sure as would need a ruler lined up at the top to see, but if there is any difference it is minimal.\\n\\nBut what is puzzling me is why do I not see any extraction spaces???   Where are they?  Why can they not be seen?\\n\\nOK: now I went back to see your earlier post, with your occlusion.   I am guessing that what I see is that your premolars were \"overlapping\" so not much space was made or visible when they were extracted?\\n\\nHere are my three concerns now:\\n\\n1. While your dental arch does not  seem retracted in Tray 14, I am wondering whether by the end of treatment they can be even more advanced!     From my (layman) guess:  your front teeth are at a straight 95 degree angle. The ideal is 105 degrees.   The ideal does not matter aesthetically, but I would want to make sure you get optimal tongue space, and if brought forward a little could give you a bit more.  A question to ask your orthodontist.\\n\\n2).   I was also concerned that the arch needs to be made symmetrical:    the right  lst molar and right 2nd molar need to expanded and rounded out, just like on the left side.   They are leaning inward. But then I  noticed that this is Tray 14.  How many trays total are there?    I imagine this is midway, and that the orthodontist plans to round out the arch and bring out those molars in the next stages....\\n\\n3). Question 3 is like question 2:  I  believe  your arch originally was narrow, or some of it (right side) caved in.  So I would ask your orthodontist if he can go for even more  widening/expansion and some advancement (or torquing forward the front four teeth).   Your teeth were likely to have been crowded initially because your palate was not wide and developed enough.   What is your Intermolar Width?   It should be 39 mm minimum in a woman.    This is the benchmark.  I cannot tell from a photo.  Has it been measured?\\n\\nThese are the questions I would ask your orthodontist.  Also---is he going to use TADS?\\n\\nBonne chance et bon courage!Hi! Thank you so much for your reply!\\nto answer your questions:\\n2- There are 31 trays and the 14th tray is mid treatment approximately. I expect to have my archs more rounded as the treatment advances. \\n\\n3-These are the measurements and differences between the two trays: \\nhttps://imgur.com/a/VJasJZQ\\n\\nNo I don\\'t think he\\'s gonna use Tads even though I specifically requested it in my first consultation, which is why I\\'m having doubts about this plan. In the clincheck he showed me, the back molars move forward and the front teeth don\\'t move at all which is reassuring but at the same time can invisalign move the molars forward without pulling the front teeth backwards (without some sort of anchorage like TAds), idk. I asked him about this, and he said that the invisalign will move my molars forward as shown in the clincheck, but i\\'m still skeptical. \\n Another thing that adds to my skepticism is the use of class 2 elastics, that are supposed to correct an overjet. I\\'m nervous about using them especially since my orthodontist said to use them for the whole duration of the treatment, because yes they do pull the lower teeth slightly forward but at the same time they pull the front upper teeth back. \\n\\nThank you so much for your reply, it means a lot.Maybe get a video Zoom consult with Dr Fareed Khan in London?   And with Dr. Zubad Newaz in Florida?  \\n\\nDr. Khan is a dentist treats extraction people for \"reversal\" with Invisalign so would be familiar with your concern about retraction elastics.   Newaz knows how to use TADS.  He also is great at answering technical questions, like the ones you listed. Reasonable consult fees too. \\n\\nDr. Ilya Lipkin in New Jersey also is a good orthodontist, who uses TADS and very good at answerign technical concerns.  His consult is pricey though:  450 dollars, including two visits (one virtual, one in presence) and a final diagnostic Zoom conversation.do you know any good orthodontists who use TADs in france, Paris?I never met one.  BUt that does not mean they do not exist.  Tania Stakowski in Paris might be an option: to call her office to see.    Antoine Gourdin might be another.  I might have more names in ten days as speaking to a French distributor of MSE devices in France, and he is bound to know the cutting-edge orthodontists in France.Thank you so much and I\\'ll really appreciate it if you send me some names :\\') cause I can\\'t find much rnwill be speaking sometime before the end of next week, so do send a note in case I do not get back to you by the 30th.    Another person who had extractions (in Holland)  also wants to know as well, so will be asking about MSE providers in Holland too.ps. those measurements are alarming.\\n\\nI think there might be an error with the measurement of the Anterior Posterior Dimension (length), as the line is not drawn under the last molars in the same way in Tray 1 and Tray 14.     There are a couple mm of space under the second, so the retraction is probably 2-3 mm less.   But still there is retraction.\\n\\nAlso the only widening is near the premolar area.

What is the Intermolar width now?\\n\\nI would also get a consult with Dr. Paul Gouhier in Paris, ENT, and ask for a fibroscopie exam to see how yout tongue to airway relationship is.  Ask for a video, and ask for a copy of that video.  It could be that you do not need widening or advancement.

Weve seen a dermatologist about it and just one thing to know it to avoid steroids at all cost - they will only make it worse long term. (Wish we knew this sooner as it was a bit of a long term struggle to get properly diagnosed and treated). We use a no steroid cream called Protopic when it happens and make sure to keep acidic foods off your face and avoid cinnamon as those can irritate. Good luck!thank you!! the dermatologist i saw told me to use steroids for it, which i havent luckily (as a long term eczema sufferer Im almost 90% against using steroids anyway). ive got some protopic so I might give it a try. thank you for your advice its much appreciated!Youre welcome!  We had a rough time getting this info so Im really glad it was helpful. We were told to use steroid cream and it kept going away temporarily and then coming back, worse than before. My daughter was a tiny toddler at the time and it was very concerning to me to use steroid cream long term but sometimes its really hard to get someone to actually correctly diagnose and advise.  Once we finally had a referral and appt with a Pediatric dermatologist they prescribed the Protopic and told me a steroid cream is actually the worst thing you can use for it, and it cleared up after a bit and rarely comes back. Now I just use it as needed if it occasionally flares up. Good luck!oh i cant imagine how hard it mustve been especially for a toddler! its been really tough for me but ive coped with it to a certain extent. Im glad to hear shes having a better time with it now!The same thing happened to me- I never had any issues until Invisalign. I switched to fluroide free toothpaste and did a round of doxycycline this cleared up the initial flare. Im still using fluroide free toothpaste and havent had any other issues! They also gave me a topical cream Metronidazole which helped a lotdid you finish your invisalign/still continuing with it? Im currently on lymecycline (1 week in, 7 to go). i definitely need to check out a better toothpaste for sureI found that the increase in brushing of teeth, particularly with fluoride toothpastes aggravates it. While I do not recommend stopping a fluoride toothpaste, what I found helps is avoiding toothpastes with SLS and mint/cinnamon oils as these are triggers as well. There are childrens toothpastes that still have the same percentage of fluoride in them as adult toothpastes. I believe one is Hello (they have a grape and bubblegum one I use, but please check with your dentist if you are concerned). Brushing your teeth first before washing your face helps, as does being extremely cautious to not get any toothpaste on the skin around your mouth.\\n\\nEdited to add: I found personally, the biggest trigger was peppermint/mint oil and SLS in toothpastes and the increase in brushing, particularly after every meal. Not so much the fluoride but everyone is different.thank you - thats really helpful. at the moment Im brushing usually 3x-4x a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) (smaller amount of toothpaste at lunch) with sensodyne. i use this to brush my invisalign too so ill definitely look at a more friendly one. i find it hard not brushing before my invisalign go in as i dont want them to be dirty if that makes sense?Definitely. I still brush around 4 times a day as well. My ortho suggested using an unscented and uncolored dish soap for retainers funnily enough. Just a small amount to wash them. I still use Sensodyne once at night before bed because I have extremely sensitive teeth and I like the desensitizing agent they use but Im super cautious to not get it on my skin. Every other time after meals I just use the fluoride toothpastes without the peppermint/cinnamon oils and thats helped. I hate the feeling of dirty retainers as well. Hopefully youll see a difference!ive seen the dish soap idea recommended but Im worried about that as I have other skin issues thats flared up by washing up liquid! its tough! thank you so much for your advice youve been a great help!!!As someone who has the most sensitive of sensitive skin, I totally empathize with you. If you ever need suggestions or recommendations for skincare, feel free to PM me. Ive pretty much tried it all with my derm. Good luck!Came here to say this. I have had perioral derm since my early 20s. It disappeared for about 14 years until Covid hit and mask wearing made it flare up again.

This is a potential red flag, however, from what I understand, the projected outcome images resulting from the 3D scan are generated by an algorithm (all of my expected \"after\" images from each provider look the same), so it\\'s not like he\\'s designing my smile, he\\'s just facilitating the treatment - is that right?  Please advise!This was ultimately why I went with an ortho rather than my dentist who does Invisalign. One has bronze credentials and the other gold or platinum. My dentist is lovely and Im sure he would have done great but experience matters more to me. Its not a small amount of money and its a life long investment. Some providers are more involved with tweaking creating their own treatment plans based off the AI. You should go with someone youre 100% comfortable with. If you feel uneasy about this providers a lack of experience look elsewhereHow can you tell if your provider hasgold/bronze/platinum credentials?You can search the provider and see their status https://www.invisalign.com/get-started/find-a-doctorThe images from the 3D scan are all generated from Invisalign at the consultation. Youre talking about the one that pops up within a minute or two right? If so, this is not the same as a clincheck which include the step by step movements which are typically dictated by the provider themselves as the plan created by Invisalign may have issues. Id say experience matters but depending on the severity of your case, the portfolio building provider may still be a good option.for myself, I just couldnt get behind having a dentist do an orthos job. my dentist wanted to do my treatment. I wanted someone with the most training and experience. I went to three orthos for consults, and went with the one with the highest rating from invisalign and the best match for me personally. I havent looked back. I waited decades for this and I want the best possible experience and outcomeIf your case is straightforward and your teeth move 100% as expected, sure - there may not be much of a difference in experience. But providers are making choices about treatment approach, as well as figuring out how to correct the course of treatment if things dont go as planned, so a less seasoned provider may have issues if your case ends up being more complicated.I went with my dentist who offered a reduced price because she was training in Invisalign and needed a case study. My thinking was it\\'s Invisalign who create the plans and retainers so how much impact does she have anyway? (Yes I was naive.) But I\\'ve probably been lucky. My teeth moved as they were meant to, at one point I thought the IPR on the bottom teeth was a bit shoddy but now the gaps are closed it\\'s fine. \\n\\nMy dentist did struggle with doing the impressions at one stage, Invisalign requested they be done twice more, whereas I think others get their teeth scanned instead? Which is probably easier. But I accept it was cheaper for a reason. If I was paying market rate I\\'d look for someone with more experience though.This is ortho field of work. Not a general dentist. \\n\\nWould you go to a general practitioner with your cancer diagnosis? No. Same with teeth.Experience matters a lot. While Invisalign can provide a generic treatment plan, you need œboots on the ground\\x9d to actively direct and manage the case as its VERY rare (unless your case is simple) that things go according to plan.\\n\\nWhat are the issues youre trying to solve with this treatment? That will better help us answer your question.The computer doesn\\'t design the treatment, the doctor does, so experience does, indeed, matter. The great majority of orthodontists will be better equipped than the great majority of dentists, and once you get an ortho above maybe the Gold level going higher and higher in experience is going to have diminishing returns.I agree with others that it somewhat depends on complexity. My case was severe and I\\'m glad I went with someone very experienced. I had one of the top providers and he still struggled. He told me originally he would rate my difficulty as 8/10 - I had a terrible bite. I was supposed to be done in December of 2019 but didn\\'t finish until a couple months ago because he just couldn\\'t figure out the final adjustments...and one of my front teeth is still a little crooked. If your case is super easy it may not matter as much!I had Invisalign treatment for crowding and bite problems, and I work at an orthodontic office. I cannot stress how important the experience is. Invisalign isnt as easy as everyone assumes it is, thats why it has the connotation it does. Find a doctor who is very knowledgeableI will request changes or tell him what I dont like and he inputs what teeth and mm of movement is needed. At every rescan this is the case so he is using his expertise and calculations not a computer generated thing. I am so happy I went with the highest tier ortho. Im finishing early and have no issues.I honestly lucked out and was referred to a VIP Diamond+ provider. I was very scared when it came to anything involving my teeth and I\\'ve had a great experience with them and my cost was greatAssuming the difference between this one and the highest quote is 1K$ and you are 30 y/o (based on your username) and you will live for at least 50 more years, 1K$ over the course of 50 years is 20$ a year -- extra 20$ a year for a more experienced specialist and more satisfied results, I\\'d definitly go for a more experienced one. Most providers do 0% interest ficing nowadays so see if that\\'s an option for the ones you are considering. \\n\\nI went with an ortho after an initial consult with my dentist and I\\'m really happy with my choice. The price difference was 5,800$ vs 4,500$. I am 3 weeks in and just saw my ortho this morning after calling him yesterday with a concern about sensitive teeth (originally not scheduled to see him until week 10). He asked very specific questions about my treatment so far and knew exactly why I was having the pain I was having related to the tray.I think going to an ortho matters most. When I asked my dentist about Invisalign, he told me œwhy? You have nice teeth\\x9d. I ultimately went to an ortho and just finished 18 months of treatment, including fixing an open bite that dentists often dont see. They usually just think about straightening teeth versus looking at your whole bite.I went with an ortho who was œonly\\x9d a silver provider, but otherwise a very experienced orthodontist. I have finished my treatment and could not be happier. She was very knowledgeable, very involved (I always saw her not just an assistant) and shes a platinum provider now. So it depends, go with someone you are comfortable with!Thank you ALL so, so much!  Everyone\\'s input has been so interesting and valuable.   You\\'ve really helped me make my decision.No thats completely wrong. Your doctor is designing your smile, and the experience is incredibly important. Thats why you should always see an orthodontist.

Everyone's technique will differ slightly given they have differing amount of attachments etc. For me I had to 'unhook' my invisalign each side twice before popping off the front, and it was simply undoable with an ortho key.\\n\\nAn electric toothbrush and a water flosser would my recommendations to get for home.Prepare to have to go to the bathroom after you eat literally anything. Also get a little pencil case sized pouch with to go tooth brush. Dont worry if you regret the decision to start when you first get them, after day 3 you definitely adjust to them and its totally normal!!Get yourself a little pouch with the œessentials\\x9d - an OrthoKey (this is IMO the œmust have\\x9d), your storage case, floss, toothbrush and toothpaste, a small thing of mouth wash (sometimes when I cant brush, doing a good rinse with mouth wash will hold me over), and some chap stick - I bring this pouch pretty much everywhere. Have some cleaning tablets ready - I used Retainer Brite initially but am just as happy with the 3 min Polident tablets. Look at pictures on this thread, be aware you will have attachments and you might have some decent pain/discomfort the first couple days, but it does go away and it does get easier - and the attachments get less rough after several days too. Know that youll pretty quickly settle into a routine, and that attachments/the trays/any very minor changes in how you talk always seem more visible/obvious to you than they are to anyone else. Be patient, it takes time to see results - a lot of the times teeth in the back are shifting and making room for the changes in the front. Be ready to have your trays in as much as possible - 20-22 hours per day - and most people will brush in public bathrooms - but dont completely stress if you cant do that here and there. If Im traveling for a few days I always bring either my previous trays or my next trays, whichever is closer, just in case I lose my trays.\", 'labels': ['oral hygiene', 'tray time management', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'self-consciousness', 'financial concerns', 'facial appearance'], 'scores': [0.4126034379005432, 0.15008489787578583, 0.13267898559570312, 0.11825224757194519, 0.09960677474737167, 0.04605238884687424, 0.04072125256061554]}, {'sequence': \"Post Invisalign- now that I have straight teeth, I need to relearn to talkI have straight teeth now!

Its been happening ever since I got Invisalign. I tried to not use lip balm but my lips get dry even when I dont lick them. Does anyone know what causes this and if youve ever experienced it? I use aquaphor btwI think it's because lip balm is not totally transparent. It goes on your lips that way but if it gets any opportunity to clump up on itself it'll become opaque in that area. If you can, switch to something completely clear like a lip oil.Ive been thinking abt oil. Can you use oil on ur lips?Oh sure.

So basically lip oil is just lip balm, just oil based? And how can it aid with the white film thing?Ya kind of. Well, like I said balm is not transparent. If you look at your aquaphor (in the jar or squeeze it out of the tube) it's not completely crystal-clear-see through...there's some opacity/cloudiness. If that clumps up on your lips after it dries a bit you'll get more opacity - the white film, especially if it mixes with a bit of saliva. If you use a product that is completely crystal clear, no matter how much it layers on itself or clumps up it will remain transparent. If you take a regular stick of chapstick and twist it up, the product looks opaque. But when you put it on your lips it's clear.

I'll check on this. Thank you very much. This means a lot to her.I SWEAR by care credit. Saved my life!!Yes! It is so beneficial! Just pay it off before the zero interest promo expires hahah! But its helped me in tight unexpected and costly situationsSome orthos do in house ficing! I pay $100 a month with a $1200 down payment (put on care credit card) and if they dont, look into care credit. Its saved my life before I swear by it! And Spark is another great alternative to invisilign. Its more durable, clearer and thinner. Still with an ortho though, but same price as invisilignYeah, I didn't know about care credit up until now and a few other people also recommended this option. Thank you so much.I was offered K line by my dentist for 80 percent of the price. Refused cause I couldn't find any reviews, reputation, nothing.That's the issue.

The first 2 weeks were truly awful for me, couldnt eat any solid food, had constant nausea and vertigo. The pain was only bad the first day or 2. I didnt realize there would be any pain ” in retrospect, this was dumb. Of course there is pain, your teeth are moving! I had a lot of anxiety, I didnt like having my fingers in my mouth and constantly felt like my teeth were going to crack those first few days. But I got over it and everything has been fine so far (1 month in). I dont like the feeling of having my aligners off now. I feel like the advertising of Invisalign that its completely invisible and you can eat whatever you want is misleading. But Im okay with them not being so invisible and realizing my diet is made up of more soft foods. I will have straight teeth in the end and that is worth it for me.[deleted]I love my ortho so far and they are highly rated, but when I called their office, they denied any knowledge of Invisalign causing symptoms like nausea and vertigo. I felt that was a bit bizarre, given in that my quick Google searches, I was able to find connections between the two. Im not entirely sure why I had the vertigo. I actually went to the ER in that timeframe because I was having other issues that started when I got Invisalign that werent getting better after medicine I got from my doctor. The ER physician had had Invisalign previously and he was quite familiar with it and how it can affect the whole body. After all my blood work and ultrasounds checked out normal, his hypothesis was that my body was creating a serious immune reaction against the Invisalign and having a foreign device. Ive never been diagnosed with any autoimmune disorder, but various doctors have pointed out how my body has had strong immune reactions in the past, but Ive been tested for autoimmune diseases in the past and no clear answers have come up yet. Fortunately, the vertigo and my other symptoms did go away after 2 weeks and Im so thankful everything has been smooth sailing since.[deleted]Thank you! It was not easy but I was determined to get to my goal of having straight teeth, even if it meant dealing with it the whole time.Good to know. Thank you!Its a part of my everyday life. But significantly longer commitment than I anticipated.Yes! Started my trays in June. Went back for refinements today  and have another 6 months to go. Was not expecting that.The latter. I worried about everything. I have some deep fillings and was worried Invisalign would cause them to need root canals, I worried about the process of taking them in/out, I worried about telling people, etc. Three weeks from now, I should done and I cant believe I worried about so much. It was just not a big deal, and Im so happy I decided to go through with it. The first week in the hardest and then, it just gets easier and easier!I was so worried about everything, now that I started, I think I made it out worse than what it is! Its really not that bad at all. Takes some getting used to and def a lot of posts made me extra paranoid of omg what if I dont brush my teeth 30 mins after eating or dont wear my trays long enough, but you get used to it very quicklyYes I can relate completely to the paranoia after reading some of the posts here lol. I just have to remind myself that most of the people that never had any issues with it are not on this sub.Exactly ! I posted a lot more before I started, now that I started I just take it day by day. Some days I brush right after dinner, sometimes I give myself some freedom for a bit before locking my teeth up again. Your mind seems to wander a lot before starting bc I think we all want to anticipate what to expect. Now its totally normal to have the trays in, to the point this morning i was rushing and realized i didnt put them back in!Thank you for this. I get my aligners in 3 weeks and have been freaking out. Im 46 and so paranoid about just getting them, much less the painstaking stuff Ive read about on here. Will try to just go with the flow and calm the F down nowOf course, Im glad I can provide some sense of relief. I can only speak for myself but its gone so much easier than what I anticipated & I have a ton of crowding. I wish I did it soonerIm 45 years old and on tray 8 if you have any specific questions for an older user Invisalign was way easier than I thought. I finish treatment after 4 months next Wednesday.Not hard or complicated at all. You just wear your trays and keep everything clean. Can they be annoying and cause some discomfort occasionally, yes.First 2 weeks suck ngl but after its so easy you dont notice and you just build a habitIt was fine and not a big deal for me. I got buttons all over my teeth which I wasn\\'t expecting actually and it was pretty crappy for the first 3 weeks.\\nPicture painful, soreness when eating or biting and I sounded like I had a lisp. I also had a lot of extra saliva as your mouth will create more because something fake is in your mouth. That\\'s normal.\\n\\nOnce I got over the first few weeks those acute symptoms went away and it\\'s been very nice to have them now. I\\'d do it again entirely if I had to go back to square 1.I was so worried about everything that I was in total meltdown mode for the 4 weeks between scans and trays. Like M E L T D O W N. Complete panic. \\n\\nIts been totally fine. Its certainly not œfun\\x9d and I want to be done as fast as possible, but turns out, I can do this. And you can too!After I paid my deposit and ordered my aligners I came to this sub to do some reading. I was so freaked out by what I read that I dodged my orthodontists attempts to contact me for at least a month after my trays arrived. \\n\\nTurns out that its not even close to as bad as I read about here. No pain. No sores. No rough spots on trays (people here acting like its normal for their orthodontist to give them a *file*??!!). Care of my teeth and the trays is not nearly as complicated as this sub would have you believe - its no different from before. Wear time is not the 22+ hour martyrdom that I read about. 19-20 hours is plenty. There are no foods that are off-limits. Not one single person has noticed my Invisalign because it really is nearly invisible. I dont have to carry gear with me when I leave the house. My trays pop in and out super quickly - it has never been a struggle or required a tool. All I do is wear the trays and take them out to eat. If I didnt have bite ramps I wouldnt even remember they were there. \\n\\nI dont worry about anything. I paid my orthodontist a lot (more than anyone Ive seen on this sub pay, but Im a big believer in you-get-what-you-pay-for) so its her job to do any worrying. I have full confidence she will deliver excellent results.First tray sucked. You get used to it after. I also had the impression that it was easy on and off whenever. It\\'s just as much work as metal braces to maintain.I massively overestimated how big a deal it is. I\\'m only on my fourth trays so I may be speaking too soon, but apart from mild tooth pain for the first couple of days of each tray there\\'s nothing else really. It\\'s easy to get into a routine of eating/cleaning and it\\'s nowhere near as noticeable as i thought it would be (and I have attachments on my front teeth). If anything it\\' s actually encouraging good habits of not snacking constantly, saying no to wine late at night, and drinking loads of water. Only serious issue for me is not being able to have my caffeine fix constantly throughout the day.This forum made me really nervous before I started, actually. I was trying to prepare myself but ended up freaking myself out more. Its not as big of a deal as I built it up to be in my head.I think each persons experience will vary based on their tolerance for inconveniences and acceptance that you cant do it without a bit of compromise over the duration of the treatment. \\n\\nIve seen people have meltdowns over attachments or not being able to party for hours on end with them out. IMO those people probably dont get told œno\\x9d a lot lol. If youre not like those people your life will probably adjust very very quickly. \\n\\nFor me, I havent had a ton of pain, only pressure. My aligners stay pretty clean without fancy shit. I average about 20.8 hours which isnt the preferred 22 hours but Im tracking and Im still fully enjoying my coffees. I carry a water bottle in my purse to rinse after if Im out and want a treat, then brush properly when I get home. Ive put them back in while standing outside on a busy street waiting for a walk sign (elastics and all) and a coffee shop table. I felt my front lower teeth slightly wiggle once but since then Ive never actively tried to wiggle them and if they can still be wiggled I havent noticed anything while eating.\\n\\nI think theres always a chance that treatment could hurt more than average or a filling could pop out or any number of bad things but I dont think that describes most  cases. Its just that if people experience those things, theyre going to post it here.Reading this sub made me terrified of the pain, discomfort, dryness, and not being able to easily remove the retainers.\\n\\nIts slightly inconvenient but its been a breeze. The hardest part is not being able to snack whenever I want (I choose not too) which is a good thing because I am not really overeating now.I honestly usually over research things and in this case my dentist who I have been going to for almost 40 years, since I was a baby basically, told me that Invisalign could fix the issue that popped up and he referred me to an orthodontist. I went to the orthodontist he referred me to and I liked her and she explained the possible solutions and that her recommendation was the Invisalign complete and I just took her work for it and have been rolling with it ever since.\\n\\nSo me, a chronic over-thinker, hardly thought about this at all which is so out of character.I was similar, in that I didn\\'t do much research beforehand.  After getting them, I definitely had a learning curve and didn\\'t expect the adjustment period, but it may have been better than reading up on them and getting nervous.  Now I\\'m just plowing ahead, waiting for the light at the end of the tunnel.Has surpassed my wildest dreams in terms of how shit it isI\\'m sorry to hear that. Are you having a hard time with keeping the aligners on your teeth for almost all day?Nope. I\\'ve just gotten constant pain, mouth sores, attachment problems, and a persistent speech slur for the past 7 months.Random advice: \\n\\nIdk if you have ever experienced restless legs, but I felt like my teeth were restless for the first day or two. Which makes total sense because they are starting to move lol.\\n\\nBut I wasn\\'t at all prepared for that part and spent that time chewing on pencil grips because it made me feel better.  Lol\\n\\nIt\\'s not a big deal and easy to combat with the chewing if you notice that feeling.I\\'m into my treatment for almost one year now. It\\'s still a hassle now and then but you will get used to it.  The end result will all be worth it!I didn\\'t think before getting it. The only considerations I had was \"do I need straighter teeth and will thay improve my oral hygiene and quality of life\". After doing research, I trust the technology and believe it works.\\n\\nIf I have to suffer some pain as a price, C\\'est la vie.I don\\'t think it\\'s too bad and I\\'m excited about the final result, so it\\'s worth it to me. I settled in pretty quickly to a routine with them and tried to make it easy for myself. I have extra retainer cases everywhere so I don\\'t run the risk of leaving them somewhere or them getting damaged (car, office, purse, etc.) and always have floss, toothbrush, and toothpaste with me (also backups in my car, etc.). Most people I know didn\\'t even notice until I told them. New tray days I sometimes need softer food but it\\'s not unbearable. In the beginning, I needed to file the edges of my trays where the little hooks are, but after a couple of sets, I didn\\'t need to because my mouth got used to them. \\n\\nRegarding the last sentence about \"just need to make sure they wear their aligners and not worry about anything else\"-- I disagree with this. I don\\'t think its as big of a deal as I initially made it out to be but you DO need to keep your gums healthy, teeth clean, etc. before putting trays back in or you run the risk of cavities, etc. I think as long as you\\'re prepared, it\\'s not hard to manage. \\n\\nEveryone\\'s experience is likely to be different though. I hope it goes well for you!If i didn\\'t have the attachments glued to my teeth I would\\'ve stopped right away.  A year later though I\\'m glad I didn\\'tI just started and my teeth dont hurt but my cheeks do the buttons are killing meI got my wisdom teeth out 5 weeks into my aligners, as well as some dry sockets, and had IPR done 1 week post op, but Im still happy with both of those decisions and aside from the dry sockets I havent encountered much pain at all, maybe some soreness at most.\\n\\nThe lifestyle change has been a very positive experience for me. I no longer snack, I religiously brush my teeth / floss like a mad man - and it has made a serious difference on the health of my gums and my teeth feel much less sensitive to hot/cold now.\\n\\nI was expecting a pain in the ass and a lot of pain in the mouth as the price for straighter teeth (plus a few grand but whos counting), but it looks like Im just ending up with a healthier mouth and better habits.\\n\\nCup half full my friends.There is this book The Highly Sensitive person by Elaine Aron that I identify with some of her stuff. For me, it has been hard managing the foreign object in my mouth and I have had the nausea at times and it just is what it is. I am getting thru . Tray 18 out of 35. Sigh. I see nice progress but it is a huge commitment.I did my research beforehand and 100% its not been nearly as big of a deal as I thought it would. The reality is you dont need to obsess after every minute they are out of your mouth as long as its not excessive, brushing your teeth as long as you brush them often and dont eat/drink sugary shit before putting them in, the pain varies.. some trays are bad some arent bad at all.. is it annoying having stuff on your teeth? Yeah. It is it horrible and unbearable? Absolutely not. My experience has really been a breeze and Id take this over braces any.damn.DAYHonestly my biggest concern since starting has been when I noticed a wiggly tooth. I SHIT until someone on this subreddit said to remember that teeth have really long roots, they\\'re not like baby teeth. That made me feel heaps better and they definitely do stop wiggling. Overall Invisalign has been much simpler than I thought it would be :)How long did it take for the wiggly tooth to become normal again? Thank you for answering!Short enough that I don\\'t actually remember - maybe a week or two?\\nNo problem at all!I worried about the pain I\\'d feel, after reading so many posts - - thankfully, I\\'ve only felt pain/discomfort for 3/140 days, so far. Everyone is different and it might be a much easier time than you are anticipating. I\\'ve found this whole process a breeze (and feel very fortunate for this!).idk, people are so different. i wasnt really too worried about anything to start with. in my opinion, its been a breeze. no big deal at all, no issues. but there are a lot of people who think carrying a toothbrush with them is the end of the world or brushing your teeth in a public restroom will kill you. i am neither of those people, so my journey has been easy and stress free. i eat when i want to/when im hungry. i dont skip meals or change plans just because of my trays.The first few days it was so painful I was regretting it all thinking I\\'m going to have to deal with that pain for 12 months. However, from the 3rd tray onwards, I don\\'t even feel any pain anymore and it\\'s all smooth sailingGreat post!! As someone who\\'s starting treatment next week, I appreciate all these comments!Glad it helped you! Definitely make me calm down right before starting my treatment too! :)People here vastly overstate how annoying Invisalign isI had big regrets the first two weeks but have gotten pretty used to them now. They can be a bit of a bother but you adapt. In terms of pain, Ive had maybe 3 days total in the last 2 months that I had to take Tylenol. Everyones teeth are different so take what you read with a grain of salt and just figure out what works best for you. Good luck!!Yeah it\\'s a non-event now. Don\\'t think I\\'ll have any issues sticking through it!The First week I seriously regretted it for how painful and inconvenient it was, apart from being difficult to talk. By the second week the pain disappeared completely and I don\\'t think it\\'s as big of a deal any more, my speech is not impacted also. The only annoying thing is I can\\'t grab a bite out when walking etc spontaneously, there needs to be some planning involvedFirst day I thought what the heck did I just get into my mouth feels soooo crowded. But after 3 days I wasnt noticing it as much and now 3 weeks later I literally do not notice them at allll. Im having a great experience and would recco them to anyone in a similar sitch to me. (Braces as a kid, no retainer wear, minor cosmetic fixes as adult)Is allot better than what I expectedI\\'m still early days but so far it\\'s fairly easy. I do regret not doing it while in lockdown because my workplace is all open plan with glass everywhere, so not easy to whack my aligners in and out with any subtlety lolIts been a breeze for me, half way through in half the time anticipated.. I had a friend a few weeks ahead of me telling me how painful it is and how hard it is to eat and drink and Ive had none of that. \\nIm so pleased with the processexcept for needing to bring mouthwash and toothbrushes everywhere, but really, its been much easier than I thought!Im 55 and an attorney (so talking is my income essentially) and on my first set of trays. Yes, getting them in and out is a pain, but already improving. Doing this more for jaw alignment issues than crooked teeth but so far no regrets.I am planning on starting Invisalign in the next few weeks. Sure, your mind can think about 15 things which can go wrong. But ultimately, there are only two things you need to do and control:\\n\\n1. Wear them 22 hours a day.\\n2.

On my last tray and the before and after is fine, but I have serious gum recession and black triangles now. I constantly get food stuck in my teeth and it makes eating at restaurants embarrassing. Anyone have any advice on what I can do?¨I was told by my ortho that minimal recession is normal, because youre literally pressing and pushing teeth into places it hasnt been before. Sometimes that is back into gum lines. \\n\\nHowever, she also said that once orthodontic treatment has completed, she has seen most of her patients gum lines naturally come back on their own. Its just the mouth is going through a bit of trauma, and is putting its energy and healing into all the movement being made. Once movement stops, your body will be able to focus its healing on a gum line that is no longer moving. You should see tissue build back. I would ask your ortho to confirm or discuss this with a periodontist.I dont think gum tissue grows backNo offense but I think youre being a tad dramatic. Nothing wrong with that, theyre your teeth! From what I can tell, you have one black triangle (in your second picture). A little bonding can fix that.\\n\\nIn terms of the gum recession, I think they look pretty normal. Talk to your ortho if youre that concerned. I dont think its a concerning amount though.Agree with this. I would get bonding if that's an option for you. I can't see any worrying gum recession (I have a small amount from invisalign too) but if its really concerning you, grafts are an option too.Drama. Lol your teeth look much better than before. The issue is people see all of these influencers and celebs walking around with veneers and think their normal teeth arent good enough.No hate, because I totally feel your sentiments on those super annoying posts that overly critique perfect teeth, and yes, OPs teeth and bite look amazing, so aesthetically I dont see any flaws. But OPs issue is with the technical function of the teeth and getting food caught in new spaces and I dont think its fair to judge them for being dramatic about how their teeth look when thats not what their post was about. Getting food caught in a perfect smile is a problem we all wish we had (versus an imperfect smile) but as they say, grass is always greener. ƒYoure absolutely correct\\n\\n\\nBut they are being dramatic hahaI know its not a major issue and my teeth look better - but I went into invisalign not really having issues with how my teeth looked before and was kind of like why not. So now having functional issues is really annoying after a year+ treatment, multiple rescans etc, when I could have just lived with how they were before  I think its fair for me to say I wish I didnt get it lol. Bc thats a personal choiceMy orthodontist said that if any black triangles emerge that are too large and annoying I can look into bonding - would that work for you?Bonding or IPR. I have the same exact problem as you the gaps are hugeIm not done with my treatment but Ive noticed the same issues - new spaces where food now gets caught. I carry flossers with me everywhere I go. Once treatment is over, gum grafts or bonding may be an option. Not sure if you can do IPR with refinements, I imagine that would extend the length of your treatment quite a bit. Your bite and smile look amazing. Besides the new gaps, your oral health is much improved by a proper bite!I really appreciate this, thank you! And true”I was okay with the aesthetics of how my teeth looked before even though it wasnt great, but the bite really needed to be fixed and Im glad it isYou have a beautiful smile. I understand how you feel about food getting stuck. I have that also. When eating outside it helps to drink water frequently and bring some flossers. A trip to the restroom and you can insure no food is visible. And finally, just to maybe lighten the situation  - I know I'm much more conscious of my teeth now, who knows what was stuck there years ago? LOL. Anyway, talk to you Doc about the triangles and food traps and see if there is something they can do. Good luck and keep showing your beautiful smile.The black triangles are very common, and some people are just more susceptible to getting food stuck in their teeth because of tooth shape. I get a lot of food stuck too and just need to floss after eating. For what it's worth, your teeth look great! Do you have any more pics of the recession you're concerned with? From pics it doesn't look like you have anything serious. I have recession on one tooth because it had to be pulled down pretty far to be in line with the rest of my teeth and I will have a consultation for grafting when I'm finished just for that one. But I think they'll only really do that if it is significant.Thank you! Heres a better photo: https://imgur.com/a/Geb1GU4 theres visible black triangles in the lower incisors, but food gets stuck in my upper and lower incisors/premolars too where theres barely any triangles visible in photos but just the slightest bit of gum recession between teeth. I think the fact that its so minor but Im still having issues with food getting stuck makes me think gum grafting or bonding might not be a good option for me. Like you said, it might just be how my teeth are shaped?Ohhh okay I see, so it's less gum in between the teeth rather than root being exposed? I have the same thing going on with my lower teeth. Specifically I have a pretty big black triangle right in between my bottom central incisors and it's so annoying! But those two teeth are kind of shaped like upside down triangles so its kind of unavoidable. They did a little bit of IPR on them to help but they don't want to do too much. I would maybe ask if bonding would helpYoooo this same thing happened to me with my back molars. Mine look exactly like yours! I was so concerned when I first realized how big the black triangles had gotten. And the food getting caught in there is super uncomfortable. Ignore the negative comments. What you are saying is valid. Its shocking to see such a big hole back there when there wasnt before. I dont have a problem with the way it looks since no one will see it, but it did freak me out at first because I wasnt used to seeing it. I also never had big chunks of food stuck in my teeth before this. My teeth look great and Im happy with the results, but I do feel disappointed about the molars and the food getting stuck now. If people are saying youre being dramatic, they obviously are not going through the same problem and just dont understand. Ive seen people be dramatic on this sub, and you are not one of them. ‘\\x8dTo clarify ” its not the look of the black triangles that bother me. But its made me uncomfortable eating out because I get food stuck in my teeth every time. Not just the visible triangle in the back, but all over. The inconvenience of that isnt worth the improvement in how my teeth look.Did they file between your teeth to narrow them a little.  Theyve filed mine twice since I started to help the teeth move into place.  Like a dental manicure. I have less problems with food between my teeth than before I started Invisalign.Yes they did once! Mines been worse because of the space between my gums and my teeth now, not so much because of where the teeth are if that makes sense[removed]Because I regret invisalign? Thats so rude lmaoReally? Therapy for asking for advice on how to deal with new spaces between teeth where food gets caught? Didnt realize we couldnt ask for advice from those who have blazed the trail before us on this sub anymore. If you had traded one problem for another I am sure you would also want to fix the new issue thats popped up, right?Oh girl, people dont like negative comments here. You have to tell them everything was amazing and no problem whatsoever or you will get downrated. I am also regretting Invisalign and people go crazy when I tell them that and why.It's very strange how if people don't agree it's so often downvoted. I get it if it's something mean-spirited for the sake of being a jerk or truly poor advice or promotion of something dangerous, but you get to have valid feelings about your personal choices that only impact your life.Do you mind saying why you regret doing Invisalign? I just hit the halfway mark and I am still not sure I will be like the end result.  I am happy my teeth arent crossed but I have issues that I hope will go away when I am done.Black triangles are normal :)I honestly feel like your teeth look perfect. The black triangle tooth in the back you are talking about isn't even noticeable to others unless you stretch your mouth to the side. If it really bothers you, bonding could be an option.Thank you! I should say, theres very small black triangles not that visible in the first photo throughout my teeth where the gum has receded. Its not that visible and doesnt bother me with how it looks, but it means food gets stuck between almost every tooth lol. But I am happy with how everything looks!Well, I have gaps that get food caught in them already, so if I complete my treatment with them still I'm no worse off. \\n\\nYour teeth look great, that food-grabbing gap sucks though. Talk to your ortho.100% understand- I now get food stuck all over and it's so embarrassing that I have been very choicey in what I eat out. I had a major major major business breakfast meeting and just ordered yogurt for fear of food in teeth. People say just go to bathroom but it's not that easy to do right after. I can't stand it and will talk to my ortho about it.

If youre going to use pain meds to mitigate that, use acetaminophen (Tylenol) not ibuprofen (Advil). Ibuprofen reduces inflammation, but that inflammation is needed to help your teeth move. \\n\\n-Get yourself a foldable travel toothbrush and dental floss to keep in your pocket/bag, and swish your mouth and brush both your teeth AND your trays each time you put them back in. If youre in a rush, chewing sugar free gum real quick can help clean out your teeth before putting the trays back in. Get a waterpik if you can, it really helps keep between your teeth and gum line clean. \\n\\n-If youre particularly forgetful, then make sure you download the Invisalign app and the TrayMinder app so you can keep track of how long you have your trays out. Always put your trays in the case, and always put the case in your pocket/bag. This makes it easier to not lose them or accidentally break them. If you still forget, it can be helpful to put the case somewhere obvious but inconvenient, like in the front of your pants or in your shoe lol\\n\\n-Use dental wax if the edges of your trays are hurting your tongue” roll out the wax into a long skinny snake and press it onto the edge. If its not sticking well, make sure your hands are warm when youre rolling it out, your tray is warm and dry when you apply it, and the lil wax snake you rolled out is thick enough. Try not to squish it on the inside very much” when you put the tray on it will smear wax on the inside of the tray and make it hard to get out. If you do get wax in there, scrub your trays with hot water and dish soap, being sure to get into the attachment bumps. \\n\\n-The only thing acceptable to have in your mouth when your trays are in is water. Everything else runs the risk of staining your trays and teeth, or getting stuck in your trays and causing cavities. \\n\\n-Its normal for the trays to have a little bit of a gap when you first switch them” your teeth need time to move to their new positions. If at the end of your tray you still have gapping, dont switch your tray, keep it in for 2-3 more days. If the gapping doesnt go away, call your doc/ortho. If the back of your tray feels like its really loose and wont grip your tooth, you can very gently pinch the edges towards each other, and that should help it grip your tooth and stay on. \\n\\n-You may have attachments fall off. If its just one or two, they probably wont reattach them right away. Keep an eye on those teeth” if they start not tracking properly and your trays arent fitting on those teeth specifically, then make an appointment to have them reattached. \\n\\n-If you have crowded teeth and you dont see changes in your smile in the first few months, dont fret. Because your smile is crowded, theres not enough room for your front teeth to be corrected. In order for that to happen, first the molars need to be moved to make space, and then the front teeth will be moved after.If there are any sharp edges you feel when having the trays in, go ahead and file them down. \\n\\nYour mouth will probably get sore around those particular places in the first week but you wont believe how fast it gets used to foreign objects. Soon there wont be any more ulcers or inflammations. \\n\\nIm on tray 2 and I completely forget that I have them in when not thinking about it.', 'labels': ['oral hygiene', 'facial appearance', 'tray time management', 'self-consciousness', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'financial concerns'], 'scores': [0.21129542589187622, 0.18831712007522583, 0.18215642869472504, 0.16462546586990356, 0.16119983792304993, 0.05337003618478775, 0.03903571888804436]}, {'sequence': 'Finished with Invisalign Express.

The teeth are overall aligning better. Had to do some small shaving on the lower front teeth to fix the crowding. I also had my upper lateral incisors pushed up into my gum a little bit so we could do some small shaving on my upper front teeth since one of them was a little chipped.If you dont mind me asking, what is Express and is the cost cheaper than regular Invisalign?

You should maybe include that explanation in your post so people understand why the drive is an issue.i just did!There are myriad reasons why going somewhere 20 minutes away, weekly, would be extremely burdensome and problematic for people. Some people dont have a car and rely on public transportation. Some people work full-time jobs where theyre required to be in the office the whole time. Some peoples jobs are exceptionally demanding, where they work 60+ hours a week. People have a mountain of responsibilities, obligations, and other things to do day-to-day. Plus, women in the workplace are often consciously/subconsciously dinged by their employers whenever they leave early to pick up their kids, let alone leave every week to go to a doc appt. It would be completely inappropriate to make someone come in weekly for their aligners”be it 5 min, 20 min, or 1 hour away.thank you for being the only logical person here.I don't disagree, OP's post just said 'I don't want to travel that far' though, not 'I can't get out of work that often' or 'there's no bus that goes near their office', so that's what I was responding to.You could always ask them to ship them to you, but you might have to arrange the courier or pick up yourself.  Highly unlikely they'd ship to you for freeTheyd have to send it to you themselves. Im sure they could charge you if they wanted. \\n\\nDont be lazy. Just go get your trays.You should really go in. My last visit, they noticed the trays were labeled wrong after looking at my progress. I dont think it is a common thing, but check ups are important.You could ask your ortho if they do dental monitoring with the scan box and get all your trays upfrontThey can. The guy I consulted with said I could either go in to get the trays or theyd ship them to me.Mines a 3 hour drive youre lucky! I go every two/three months and if I cant make one and due a new batch I get the first tray posted then rest at my check up. (You get given a few sets of slingers each time so dont need to visit weekly!)Uber.Mine is giving me trays every 2 or 3 months. Its very difficult for me to get to him.My doctor is 45 minutes away ……Id imagine theyd want that opportunity to go over the Invisalign plan with you and make sure the trays fit correctly. \\n\\nI travel two hours each way every ten weeks to see my ortho. Its a necessary part of treatment.My ortho is like an hour away and gave me all my trays at the start. Still going there for checkups after about 6 weeks. \\n\\nDont be lazy, its worth spending the time so they make sure all is going wellBad idea. Your trays could get lost. 20 mins is not that bad at all. If you already went there once, then going again shouldnt be a problem. You wont have to go there often.Im sorry but, 20 minutes is seriously that big of an issue? Its important to go in person so they can check progress when they give you new sets of trays. Its just part of the process. I only went in like every 2 months.Like, 20 minutes is too far to travel?

So far the pain has been manageable. I only feel discomfort on my right side of my mouth when I take them off.Ive had some pretty bad headaches with new trays, but not all of them.  I take a couple of ibuprofen the night Im changing if I feel the headache coming on, and it usually prevents it or keeps it mild.  I know a lot of docs say not to take ibuprofen, but its usually just one day for me.  So far no tracking issues.I have had some soreness on specific teeth, but its bearable. Only noticeable when Im eating or clenching. Tylenol helps with that. I was NOT prepared for feeling like I had itchy gums. Im on my 3rd trays with 14 day changes. So far, days 1-2 were super itchy with each new tray - annoying, but not painful. I found myself using mouthwash and sucking my saliva to œscratch\\x9d the itch frequently.

What do you think about the teeth?The teeth look straight, most of the cosmetic issues seem to be coming from the way the teeth are shaped, which cant be fixed withortho. Have you discussed contouring / edge bonding?Planning on filling the two canine teeth. Those are my biggest concern tbhIt the canines are whats bothering you, def get them contoured and see how it looks before paying for more treatment.\\n\\nOne thing my ortho explained is that due to root placement / shape of the teeth, the edges of my two front teeth would never line up perfectly. so I had them filed at the end of treatment - came out perfectly.That\\'s a good idea, I think I\\'ll give it a try. Thank you\\nDo you have any cons on the teeth filing?Do you think this is a decent result. My other ortho was pffering me options like braces and an invisible brace(lingual kind,) from inside but I will have to pay over $5000 to $7500 to do that. Mind that I just paid the whole invisalign treatment. The attachments are yet to be removed. What do you think?Were you offered traditional braces along with Invisalign?  Were you told you would get better results from traditional braces?Well I went in asking if invisalign would work, that\\'s the method I preferred and they said yes it should fix the bitting and the crooked teeth$5000 to $7500 is a lot to pay though.  Were you satisfied with your ClinCheck?You would have to pay that money on top of the $$ you already spent on Invisalign treatment??? No way stick with your current ortho and as part of your Invisalign package you can request more trays if youre not happy - also can get composite bonding done to change the shape of your teethI personally think they are good and I would be happy with that smile, but its not about getting the perfect smile its about getting self confidence in your own smile so really only you can answer if youre happy with it or want to continue with more treatmentI paid for additional treatment,  and am afraid that if I request more treatment I would Have to pay againI would ask to intrude longer lateral incisor and extrude shorter one so that they are of equal length. Edit, after more careful observing I concluded they are the same length, that are central incisors that are tilted. Hard to believe Invisalign can\\'t make them all more parallel. Is middle picture \"before\" mirror image of after? Central incisors are tilted to opposite direction so I believe it is mirror image? Yes it is a big movement of roots but seen bigger on this sub. Maybe to find 3rd opinion. Those are really small nuances, your teeth have really nice shape.Middle picture is mirrored yes. The afters are not mirrored. Do you suggest I start the new treatment or I ask for more treatment time with invisalign?I would ask refinements to make central incisors parallel and of equal length, before any other things being done, maybe that will not be needed any more. I suppose refinements are included in your plan? It is significantly better so they just need to finish what they started.It appears to me that your entire upper set of teeth are slanted! Look at your midline in comparison to your upper lip. I would NOT accept this as a final result and would demand they finish out your treatment.This isnt something fixed by orthodontist work, its fixed by a surgeonIm sure the ortho would laugh if you went in and demanded this be fixed by invisilign.How is straightening the midline and adjusting tooth position NOT an orthodontists job? I dont see a jaw issue here at all.Its the position of her upper jaw, not necessarily the position of the teeth that are making them slantedThen why is there no jaw misalignment in the œbefore\\x9d photo?I had a VERY  similar slanted issue with my teeth and Invisalign has fixed it, so. Idk. Im not sure I see what youre seeing in this pic. Can you explain which area(s) make you think jaw alignment vs tooth alignment?I feel like the pic I posted is misleading and not straight angle, fron what I am realizing now. I\\'ll work on posting a better onePosted a new post, please check. what do you think?Central incisors are not perpendicular to the lips (and to the jaw, it seems); they are slanted.  \\nCanine on the right of the picture is much longer then canine on the other side. Look at how it reaches down touching you lip, while the other does not. Maybe also the premolar on the right side has the same issue. All upper teeth on the right side look slightly slanted, too. All things that can be fixed with invisalign.Invisalign isnt a miracle worker. Youve got a canted jaw which can only be fixed with surgery. For Invisalign, thats probably as good as it can possibly be. It doesnt fix everything. So youd need to seek alternative treatment for a better result than that.They look great and a massive improvement from where you started.\\nMy current teeth are very similar to your final results but with flaring of my front teeth outwards and my upper arch is off-center. I was deemed not suitable for invisalign unfortunately and will have to go with braces. Unfortunately there are some cases that invisalign is unable to correct.\\n\\nDid your dentist say that you would need braces or can invisalign refinements further improve your results if you wish to do so?No he was telling me invisaligns can\\'t do much more in this case. He advised either braces or a lingual type of brace. I feel like he was trying to sell me into those tbhYour teeth look so good! I wonder if you will like the results better once you get your attachments off (that\\'s one of the issues I\\'m also dealing with). Also, don\\'t be afraid to ask what refinement trays could do for you. If this is the best that can be done (which look great, btw), ok fine, but make sure your dentist/ortho is answering all the questions you have. Invisalign isn\\'t cheap so you have the right to make informed decisions. Good luck with everything! Either way, I think your teeth look fab!I LOVE YOUR CANINES!!!!!!!Really lol? That\\'s my biggest concern lmaoOmg I think its so cool to have fangs both upper and lower! \\n\\nKeep them fangs!!!!!!How can I post a new picture in this existing post?Nice progress! I also noticed your clear button, mine is silver, but its on a molar, so its okay.You do have to remember a lot of the final results we see are after someones had bonding and stuff done too, your teeth look greatdid you ask your dentist exactly what would have been done differently or what they see could have been improved more? I hate getting vague criticism!In the before picture your jaw doesn\\'t look canted at all.  \\nIn the after picture all the teeth on the right side look \"longer\" and slanted. But the jaw still does not look canted.  \\nI had a lateral incisor that ended up to be longer than the other one (after being straightened), so that the jaw looked canted. That incisor was \"pushed back\" into the jaw by my ortho, using invisalign. Also I had a central incisor that was slanted on one side, and the ortho straightened it using invisalign.   \\nIf the only way to fix your teeth properly is spending more money,  I suggest that you change ortho. Maybe ask your dentist what he would suggest to make your teeth actually straight. But if you paid for invisalign full, your current ortho should go on with further refinements till the final goal is reached. Provided he is capable to do it...I mean, your jaw *looks* canted because of the position of the teeth, but the actual bone does not seem canted to me. Same as it was with me before refinements.I personally have teeth almost exactly like yours. I had regular braces in 2013 and didnt realize until this year that I had a canted smile even though my teeth were straight - they just werent straight in relation to the rest of my face lol. \\n\\nI will be getting Invisalign to fix the cantedness and the base treatment only takes 14 weeks. I would look into this further. I personally wouldnt be satisfiedYou can fix a canted smile with orthodontics?  I truly don\\'t know, but it seems the majority are saying you need surgery.Yep according to my ortho! The projected results are amazing.

I kept my last pair and also brought my next pair in case I lost them but no tragedies happened.What spray do you use?AlignerFresh portable white foam spray, got on Amazon.

I havent been poisoned or killed by the spray use so I guess Im safe Im another person who doesnt head to the bathroom to take them out unless I happen to have forgotten sanitizer and need to wash my hands before removal. Ill often just duck down like Im digging through my bag, take them out and toss them in a case, or use a napkin to cover my mouth while I pull them out. Its quick and hardly noticeable. \\nWhile at home Im usually good about only having water with them in, but on vacation I tend to leave them in while drinking, especially if were out at a brewery or something where I would have them out for a couple hours.

Plus I'm not going to sit down at a Restaurant for every meal.A great suggestion I read is to buy some food service gloves to use for taking them out on the go.  Then you can turn the glove inside out with the aligners inside & stick in your pocket if you dont have a case.  Great for situations where you dont have easy access to wash your hands, because hand sanitizer tastes awful.I just had this, tray 5, all inclusive holiday for a week. The first few days I was running off to the room before and after each meal to take them out. Good for getting my steps in each day but a ball ache. \\n\\nI have attachments on every tooth so use the removal tools, had my case in my bag and bent over, popped them out and in the case just before getting to a table. \\n\\nI drank beer with them in and probably too many cocktails, that I won't be doing as much again as I started dreaming my teeth were rotten! \\n\\nI also took tray 4 + 6 with me just incase i broke 5, I ended up keeping my tray 5 in a few extra days and changing when I got home as I couldn't be bothered with the pain whilst on my last day away. \\n\\n\\nIt's not as big a deal as you think, you'll figure out what you can be bothered doing whilst you're on holiday and just roll with that. There's no wrong answer if it works for you, you have a good time and don't upset your teeth too much! Have a good time!Im going on vacay in a few months and am so worried about my teeth with the sugary cocktails!I'm on holiday right now and it's fine.  Kind of sucks that I can't snack or drink as much as I want as it's a small hassle to go to the bathroom, floss, brush, and put the trays back in. My fiance is so patient as that whole thing takes me like 10 minutes (I also use the restroom during this time)I travel every other month for at least a weekend. I love walking and eating. Its my favorite thing to do. \\nI always have flossers with me, I carry a couple every day in my pocket and pick out the food I once Im done then trays go back in. \\nI do feel em dirty at the end of the day and I clean em with my vibrating toothbrush; gets all the gunk. \\nI got use to the feeling, it was pretty uncomfortable at first but now Im just like.. fuck it, Im gonna enjoy my time and a minor inconvenience is not gonna ruin my days.Buy listerine (or any other brand) mouthwash tabs, theyre a life saver. Alternatively use water and brush as soon as eating as you canI went on my honeymoon and my orthodontist had me just stay in the same trays for the 2 weeks between my wedding and honeymoon so that I could just wear them as retainers to bed at night. It slowed my treatment down by 2 weeks, but I am finished now and I dont regret it.Congrats!\\n\\nAlso doing the same here. When Im on a holiday and Ive been keeping the trays outside of my mouth for too long (4-6 hours at a time) I just prolong the treatment by 1 week. If I feel that Ive been slacking and teeth are uncomfortable when Im back home, I will keep the same tray for 2 weeks, instead of switching after 1 as I have to. That makes sure that I dont strain my teeth after giving them a break.It's not a big deal. I just brought my case or set them in a napkin inside my purse while I ate. Swished some water after dinner and dealt with cleaning at the hotel room.I take mine out whilst sitting at my desk at work and I put them back in at my desk too. These people know me, they know I have Invisalign so never comment on it. If your going on holiday your probably not gonna see this people every again so. I wouldnt worry about itIf you want to avoid any saliva dribbles, I just keep my mask on and pop them off. I just keep sanitizer and maybe some wet ones to quickly wipe down my retainers. Its really not embarrassing to meHonestly youre going to get so good at discreetly removing & popping them back in..

Well, I've got an update, and it's pretty disheartening.\\n\\nI called my ortho on Tues. and got an appt. for the following day. I brought them my last liners, the first Vivera that had become misshapen, the second set that were also starting to change shape, and the ones I hadn't worn yet. My orthodontist was stumped. He said he'd never had a patient whose Vivera retainers had changed shape like mine. He was also surprised to see that my bottom teeth have started pressing against my top teeth which is what is most likely causing my relapse. (This is a problem I believe was created by the Vivera retainers because I didn't have this issue at all in my regular liners.) The only solution is another round of refinements (thankfully, there will be no charge), and possibly IPR on the bottom teeth to get them further back so they'll stop pushing on my top teeth.\\n\\nLuckily, my ortho had an opening so I got scanned that same day, but I'm super bummed about going back to wearing liners 22/7. Being able to spontaneously snack in front of other people was the best part of finishing my treatment! I go back in a month, so I guess I'm gonna have to enjoy snacking like a normal human while I still can.Sounds super frustrating! What about using a hawley retainer?Did you soak them in hot water?Nope. I did all the right things according to the user pamphlet. I think they were just made wrong, were faulty, or, and it's a long shot, but perhaps I'm doing crazy things with my jaw in my sleep? lolI remember your post. \\n\\nDid he tell you now to wear them full time for 6 months?When I go back to get my new liners in a month I'm gonna ask about it. I was so overwhelmed after seeing my orthodontist genuinely surprised/concerned by my according to him never-before-seen Vivera issues and quick relapse that I forgot to ask. Aren't the last 4 sets of the refinements always the same liners though? I guess maybe most people at my ortho office only need a month or so of stabilization? Or does not everyone have 4 sets of the same trays at the end of their treatment? Maybe it was just me.Not everyone has 4 trays bc not everyone gets Vivera. Vivera is the most expensive one bc its made by Invisalign \\n\\nI wish you the best :)I was talking about the last 4 trays of my refinements, not the Vivera, but thanks!Thats weird.

From reading other posts I can see that my treatment is a bit unusual in a couple of ways. I am on 4 day changes and have 83 trays in total. This is standard at my ortho, he prefers to have more frequent changes as he thinks it's more comfortable for the patient. He also really likes to use attachments so I  have a lot of those - 15 in total. I will have IPR but only later in the process.\\n\\nI found the process of having the aligners fitted was fine. When the ortho first put the attachments on they were really rough and scratchy, but he polished off the edges and they were fine.  The sensation of the polishing tool was a bit unpleasant but not painful.\\n\\nThe first couple of days after I had the trays fitted were pretty rough - actually so bad I questioned whether I was doing the right thing in opting for Invisalign. I was very conscious of the sensation of the trays in my mouth and I developed mouth ulcers where they came into contact with the inside of my lips. The worst bit was taking the trays out, which I found incredibly difficult and painful as they would catch on my crowded front teeth and I basically felt like I was going to rip my teeth out every time. Eating was also difficult as my teeth were sore and the attachments got in the way. I naively thought that after taking the trays out it I would be able to eat and drink normally. Adjusting to eating with the attachments has been challenging as they really affect the sensation of biting and chewing, and in some way I don't understand actually seem to affect the taste of food. \\n\\nThe other thing I've found challenging is to adjust to not snacking and drinking between meals (other than water). Because it's been painful to take the trays out I have definitely not wanted to do it more than 3 times a day.  I've been quite hungry and I've had to cut way down on tea and coffee which I normally love. I also feel like the process of brushing and flossing every time I take the trays is a bit hard on my teeth. I was always told by my dentist to wait 30 minutes after eating before brushing, which clearly conflicts with the demands of Invisalign where you need to get the trays back on as soon as possible. I know that some people are more relaxed about this bit of the process - snacking and drinking with the trays on and not brushing every time - but for now I am following the rules. I do feel one of the advantages of the 4 day changes is I won't need to worry too much about staining or wear on my trays.\\n\\nThe really good news is that after a week the discomfort is almost completely gone. I feel accustomed to having the trays in my mouth now and don't really think about them. All the ulcers are gone. It is much easier to take the trays out - still slight discomfort but bearable. And this is after changing to my second tray. After how bad the first few days were I honestly did not expect things to improve so fast.\\n\\nI was worried about how visible the trays would be but I can honestly say they are fine, even with all the attachments (although mine are mainly on the sides, from the canines back). I don't think anyone is going to notice them unless they're close up and staring at my mouth.\\n\\nAfter a week my main concern is that I still speak with a noticeable lisp - well noticeable to me, anyway. I'm hoping that will improve soon.I wish I could 4-day changes! Have 2 weeks changes and hate how less clear the trays are in the 2nd week despite using polident tabs, cleaning them with dish soap, and other suggestions here.\\n\\nCompletely agree on the eating and snacking experience. Eating a lot less and definitely drinking less coffee and wine now \\xad - complete lifestyle change.\\n\\nAlso - I would follow their instructions about the brushing rule and waiting 30 mins. You damage your enamel if you brush right awa. Since the enamel is the white part of your tooth once you start stripping it away, it leaves you with a yellower smile which is a shame if you are doing all this work to make them straight.Your ortho has made a well educated decision most probably. The stress vs time curve for these plastic aligners decreases exponentially so the longer you keep wearing the same tray the lesser is its effectiveness. Keeping that in mind I think a 4 day change is probably better than a 1 week one and definitely better than 2 weeks.\", 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'facial appearance', 'tray time management', 'oral hygiene', 'financial concerns'], 'scores': [0.23298877477645874, 0.19711191952228546, 0.13934274017810822, 0.13360793888568878, 0.12643872201442719, 0.08811241388320923, 0.08239743858575821]}, {'sequence': \"My Invisalign before and after&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/99vaqn9uquu81.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6af6067466e4b3d6ee266791520eb9b7873abd06\\n\\nI found this sub useful when I started my Invisalign journey so thought id post my before and after in case it's helpful for anyone.\\n\\nJust to start off the after pictures aren't quite finished yet, I actually have three trays of my refinements to go on my bottom set of teeth and I still need to get my teeth polished after the composite bonding, but the result is 99% there.\\n\\nI had 13 initial trays, then 7 refinements on the bottom set of teeth. I have peg lateral incisors and they just would not move after a certain point, I had to go back trays a few times, constantly chewed chewies day and night but they only moved so far. In the end, it wasn't really an issue because the original treatment plan had them moving down a fair bit which would have given me an uneven gum line as they are so small. The only trade-off is that they are still at a slight angle so I don't have perfectly straight teeth from a vertical point of view (if that makes sense) but it's kind of horses for courses because I also have a nice straight gumline at the top.\\n\\nAt the end of the initial 13 trays, it was therefore decided the top was fine as it is but the lower front four teeth still needed a bit of straightening up hence the 7 refinements. It's a fairly minuscule change, hence posting now while I still have a few trays left. I started in July last year so it has taken around 9 months My dentist didn't want me to have to wait until the bottom teeth had gone through their refinements to get the top finished hence why it has worked out like that. I have a wire retainer fitted on the top and I've been scanned for my top retainer, I will then go back and be scanned for my lower retainer once I've finished tray 7 (I'm on 5 now).\\n\\nI had opalescence whitening which was really effective, my dentist said some of my teeth are actually lighter than B1, so the bonding is actually ever so slightly darker, but will naturally even up over time, and then I can top up the whitening again every so often.\\n\\nI had composite bonding on the two peg lateral incisors to make them bigger and a little bit on the bottom of my two front teeth.\\n\\nI am absolutely chuffed with the results, however the weird thing is because the change was so gradual I can only really look back and think how bad my teeth looked, rather than looking at them now and thinking how great they are if that makes sense to anyone? They kind of just seem normal to me now, but horrible how they were before.\\n\\nThe weird thing is I never actually thought my teeth were that bad (I'm 40 and have waited this long to get it done) I'm looking forward to seeing people who I haven't seen for a while who will probably notice it the most.\\n\\nApologies for the poor before photos (especially the natural smiling one bottom left) but looking back I didn't show my teeth that much)\\n\\nEdit to add my peg lateral incisor on the right as you look at the pictures is smaller than the left one, so the treatment plan involved creating a gap between it and the canine next to it to make it the same size as the other one. I also forgot to add I got my canines filed down when I had the bonding done as well as, they were a bit vampire like before!Great results.

I really, really dont want to have them removed as Ive already had several teeth removed in the past due to having a small jaw and the pain was unbearable. Im almost certain this is what caused the midline shift in the first place too and I dont want it to become even worse to the point it cant be fixed.\\n\\nIs this really something that should be done before having treatment?Teeth naturally shift forward. Its called mesial drift. Having teeth extracted shouldnt have caused your midline shift. If your ortho is recommending it, I would do it. I got my four wisdoms removed a month before I got my aligners. Wisdom teeth usually cause more problems than not and if youre younger its better to get them removed now than when youre in your 50s and the body recovers more slowly.I have all of my wisdom teeth in and I don't need them removed. That was a condition of my treatment. First I met with an assistant and I told her I didn't want them removed and she said it's possible I wouldn't need them removed as her husband has his, and then the orthodontist confirmed I don't need them removed. It's becoming more understood they don't need to be removed as long as there's room and they aren't causing issues (bite, infection from poor brushing, etc.). If you have enough room in your mouth and they're fully erupted and healthy, it's possible to keep them. If they aren't all three of those things don't assume you can keep them, though. It sounds like you may have some other factors at play. Get a few consultations from different orthodontists and see what they say.I had the same story, but both - my dentist and orthodontist - told me all 4 have to be removed. First - to add space for the rest of your teeth when moving, 2nd - wisdom teeth in a long term can damage teeth next to them which are most important to keep healthy. I had 3 wisdom teeth extracted, one more to go this week. Didnt even have to take painkillers, but I guess you have to choose dentist for extractions wisely. Trust your doctors, it will be ok! :)Im on my last tray. My dentist did my Invisalign she said I can pull them this summer once treatment is done. I was actually really nervous about extractions to the point I put off dental work and Invisalign. Finding a dentist who was really understanding allowed me to meet my goals and get my dream smile while not pressuring me to immediately do my extractions calmed me down to the point I am fine with getting them out this summer. My teeth are straight and look great. Find someone who makes you feel comfortable its out there but sometimes it takes a few tries.Personally I have an over jet and my ortho recommended getting my wisdom teeth out to fully correct it , but it has never caused me any problems and Im fine getting it slightly smaller. My main concern is the gaps in my teeth anyway. My mouth always had spare space for my wisdom teeth and they all came out straight and healthy so I didnt want to extract them if they arent causing any harm and they were fine with that.\", 'labels': ['physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'tray time management', 'facial appearance', 'oral hygiene', 'self-consciousness', 'financial concerns', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns'], 'scores': [0.3364850580692291, 0.18281446397304535, 0.15653502941131592, 0.11913704872131348, 0.10519301146268845, 0.05960456281900406, 0.04023085534572601]}, {'sequence': \"starting my invisalign journey today! tray 1/20! im very anxious but im excited!Congrats!! cant wait to see your results :)thank you!! :) me too!! this should also hopefully fix my nasty overbite i got going on, they showed me the before and after and it looks beautiful!! i'm so excited!Good luck!

This post is for those who have ortho's that have recommended them to eat with their Invisalign's in, because I guess that is what Invisalign now encourages?? Anyways, for those who do it, could you provide me with your experiences with the do's vs. don'ts when eating with the trays in? I know the don'ts include spice that have coloring! Thanks in advance for sharing what has worked vs. not worked for you. \\n\\nI get my first trays soon!I would guess that the instruction to eat with them in (or that it is ok to eat with them in) may be more related to treatment fidelity than anything. \\n\\nI personally eat ~2 meals per day - so I take them out when I eat and was instructed to take them out when I eat. \\n\\nIf you eat more often - or are a snacker/grazer.your ortho/dentist may consider this lifestyle and figure its best for your treatment fidelity to keep them in - as the damage of having them out multiple hours per day is more than whatever eating with them in will do. Still a cost/benefit decision Id say (although I dont know this). \\n\\nLike if you are used to eating all the time - snacks, tasting things while you cook, 5 small meals a day, etc.it would lead to you not wearing your trays for 22hrs a day. If you get those 22 hours with the price of some possible worse stainingseems ok. \\n\\nThats what my guess would be since people seem to get different advice.\\n\\nEdit: typoThere are a number of people here who eat with aligners in, on orthodontist's direction (not sure of best search term to find comments). Tips often seen: eat softer/easier to eat food, pre-cut larger pieces as biting into food isn't the same, cold/cool/warm”not hot, clean your teeth and trays following. I've done it occasionally when trying to extend wear time/road trips/errands - my trays got ++ scratched up due to what I chose to eat (Hard Bite chips, etc.), so I am especially thorough at cleaning them following to try to keep clean the new scratch-mark crevices. I find the scratches quite distracting (my tongue won't leave them alone), so I try to time eating scratchier foods to days close to my 14 day swap dates. Also, intermittent fasting helps extend wear time, if you find you don't like eating with them in.Thank you!!! I was concerned about chips. this is very helpful. Appreciate everything else you have shared too.so i dont eat with my aligners in at all, but what i do allow myself to do is drink coffee or something with the aligners in on the day im going to change them (and preferably changing them right after im done with my drink). i rinse and brush after doing this, and since i dont need to wear that aligner anymore, i dont have to worry about it being stained. it might seem super trivial, but it lets me drink my beverages in peace and not chug them in under 10 minutes ‚haha thank you for sharing!Lol I do the exact same ƒChug them in under 10 minutes \\xad\\xad\\xad I felt thatMy ortho recommended me to eat with them in because of my crossbite class 2, my experience : dont eat curry or mustard with them in Ive tried everything and couldnt clean the yellow part on the traysThank you!!I eat 3 meals a day, 9am at work 12pm lunch and dinner 5 or 7pm.  I only remove my trays for 5 or 10 minutes 3 times a day after a meal to  brush my teeth and clean the trays.\\n\\nI am week 16/32 and my dentist says I am doing fantastic.\\n\\nSo easy tbhThank you!!My ortho says to eat with them in. People get very offended by this, but I am just following my orthos advice. He has more experience than random reddit folks. \\n\\nDo eat breakfast (cereals, bread/ toast, eggs and bacon). Eat ice cream (helps with pain too). Drink everything always. Im on 5 day changes. Even if my trays get stained it wont be crazy after 5 days. \\n\\nDont eat Kraft Dinner. Hello highlighter yellow trays. \\nDont force it. Start with easy food. Its weird to eat with them in. Ive had them for over a year now and have just gotten to being able to eat an apple! Am I a god?! Maybe!\\nDont forget to brush, or at least rinse really well. Trays will get scuzzy faster. \\n\\nFeel free to ask more if you want!Same for me, I'm on a by-weekly change and eat with them in. I just make sure to brush my teeth and aligners after every meal.\\n\\nI also plan my meals around the tray changes, so anything containing turmeric will be eaten the day of the change as to not walk around with fluorescent yellow teeth.\\n\\nThe first few days/trays will feel super weird, so just eat oatmeal, yogurt, rice, etc. Anything very softThank you!

RIP lol!! TY for sharing.Aldo mustard and onion stainThank you so much. This is very helpful. I eat 3 meals a day and 2 snacks in between them. How about chips/pretzels those types of crunch-ish things?\\n\\nI mostly just drink coffee and water.

Thank you!! \\x9dï¸\\x8fI would totally eat the crunchy snacks. Maybe leave out the cheezies and ketchup chips (Canadian). \\nI drink tea every day with mine in. Not once have they warped from heat. But be careful anyways I guess. \\nHappy snacking!Where did you hear recommendations that we eat with the aligners in? My dentist said never eat anything with them in.[deleted]Crissbite, me too. I could NOT eat with them out. Period. I had regular braces as a child and honestly I experienced much worse food sensations with those.My ortho recommends it if youre a heavy snacker or eat more than 3 meals throughout the day. Now I tried once, it was awful and would never do it again. So Ive lost some weight eating much less often.The feeling of biting down on something with the trays are like nails on a chalkboard now. There's something about chewing with separation from your teeth that creeps me out.My ortho, who is hearing it from Invisalign.Just a heads up, Invisaligns website says to take them out to eat or drink. Not doubting your ortho but its unlikely thats coming from Invisalign. Maybe its a compromise between time and cleanliness? https://www.invisalign.com/how-invisalign-works/living-with-invisalign-clear-alignersIn some cases you have no other option but to eat with your aligners in.\\n\\nI had two extractions on my lower teeth and I use elastics to close the gap which only my ortho can change(it's not the regular elastics I use over my trays).\\n\\nThe first time I got the elastics and tried to eat, the food would go to that area and get my elastics off the hook or even break them and I had to go back to my ortho asap to replace the elastics so I was advised to eat with them in.Some orthos recommend it. Seems crazy to me thoMy ortho also told me I can eat with them in. I take them out for curries and hot soups. I don't know why people get so triggered at the mention of eating with them in lol. It's not like the food is sitting for hours in the trays. I still take them out after eating to brush/floss teeth and clean the trays. It's not gross or anything.Can I ask you a question: why do you eat with them in if you take them right out to brush and floss?Increase wear time, eating takes a while for some people^I eat with them in because only one top tooth touches my bottom teeth while my crossbite uncrosses... you can't chew with one canine thats moving and sore. My trays are made to  create molar contact while in.I appreciate you responding! Thank you.I'm not sure why there's so many people here convinced that they know better than orthos ‚ with my treatment there's a risk of losing a tooth and my ortho told me in that case I'd have a pontic in my aligners and only remove them for brushing. So in that case I would be fine eating with them. It sounds to me like there's nothing wrong with eating with them but for practical reasons eg staining/ difficulty eating the general consensus for most people is to take them out.Thank you!!I tried it once. Ate a soft pretzel at a theme park with them in. It was a weird and unpleasant experience.\\n\\nI didn't realize until seeing some of the crossbite posts in this thread that there were people that had to eat with them in for support.I dont eat a lot of crazy stuff with them in but from experience, Ive learned I cannot go so long without eating or drinking soo.. I drink bubbly with a straw often cause I cant just do normal water all the time, goldfish (chewing lightly), life saver gummies, and iced coffee with a straw. These are the things that just work for me during the day. Take it with a grain of salt and find what works for you! I cant do without iced coffee lol. PS: I certainly soak my trays morning and night and brush my teeth three times a day or more if need be with my electric sonicare toothbrush so no cavities arise! Hope this helps!Thank you!I have cereal I eat for in-between days (softer like Rice Chex) and my favorite cereal I eat the morning before I trade trays.  \\n\\nForget bagels and chewy breads - you just end of tearing it (not pretty).  \\n\\nWill be finished May 18th and am so ready, then the crowns.  Yay!Thanks so much for sharing! And congrats for being done soon!!!Don't: eat with Invisalign in\\n\\n\\nIMHOEating is 100% in the DONT column. You won't be able to chew properly, itll ruin your trays, and its just wrong.. take em out for the 10 15 minute meal,  rinse out (or brush if you have it) and pop em back in..People should follow their doctors advice.>Same for me, I'm on a by-weekly change and eat with them in.

You shouldn't be eating with them in. They could get damaged and on top of that; the joy you get when you do get to eat would be ruined by having them in.

It's helped. \\n\\nI'd describe mine as a restless ache that eases when I chew on a chewie for a bit. Maybe try that and see if it helps?Itll pass but it might take a few days to do so. Youre basically waiting on the body to realise that actually it wants to allow the teeth to move. They will be tightness and a bit of soreness when you go up a tray, but this first bit is meant to be the worstI remember the first 48 hours sucking beyond belief. I couldnt imagine ever getting used to the discomfort and pain. But it does subside and eventually, even right after tray changes its not so noticeable.My first day too!  No pain for me yet, have only been in them for like two hours so far though, hopefully I'll be one of the lucky ones.I was very similar, by that night I was feeling it and day 2/3 were the worst. I do have a carriere appliance and rubber bands along with the trays though. It does get better. Im day 10 now. I am concerned about switching trays tonight lol.Ah, we shall see then. I don't have any bands, but I do have buttons on like every tooth besides my front four on bottom and front two on top.I hope you are one of the lucky ones and stay pain free!!Its so weird though. The only real pain is my canine. Is this normal I wonderYes, mine switch off lol one day it will be one tooth the next a different its so weirdI just received mine today too and have been in for 5 hours.. and I dont feel any pain what so ever (knock on wood). Im sorry you do!how long did it take for u to get yours?Quite long. Ortho wasnt happy with Invisalign movements so probably took about 1.5 months from paymentIt gets better. Im on day 10. Power through day 1-3 were definitely the worst. I am concerned for the pain level tonight when I switch to my new trayI felt exactly like this 3 weeks ago. It gets better. By day 3 you will start to forget you have them in.my first trays, i went from dentist to a hair appointment. my appointment was at 8, hair appointment at 10. Halfway through my hair appointment (i have a TON of hair) I felt lightheaded and took my trays off for a small bite of food. \\n\\nI wanted to die when I took them off, it hurt so bad. Literally the worst thing ever. \\n\\nWhen i got home and tried to eat, even chicken salad (soft) I wanted to cry. \\n\\ntaking them on and off at the beginning sucks. my front teeth hurt so bad. \\n\\nyou can do it.This is me! The rest of my teeth are fine. Its just the one canine thats killing me :(take pain meds (i think youre supposed to take tylenol, but I cant remember) if you need to! I know a bunch of us like to breathe through the pain, but it makes it easier. \\n\\nand remember not to clench your jaw to make teeth feel better! that causes headaches.Dont worry, tomorrow will be easier and on day 3 youll be eating sandwiches without any issues. Im on day 4 today and had the same feeling like you did in my first 24 hours. \\n\\nTake a look at your clincheck and see if those 2 teeth are moving with 1st tray. If they are that is the reason why they feel sore.The 1st didnt hurt me at all :/ try ibuprofen, it will get better! Im told the beginning hurts for some people because its teaching our teeth to move. And then after that it becomes easier! I see relief in your future!!Dude- i was in agony for 2 weeks with them.\\n\\nIt definetly gets better though, i honestly couldnt see the light at the end of the tunnel when i started and regretted it-\\n\\nBut im 9 trays in and i forget im even wearing them now so keep cracking onThanks so much.

They said a hygienist will do the insert for me and I won't meet with the doctor (nor is she going to be there that day). \\n\\nIs this common for Invisaligns where you don't have the doctor but the whole hour is just with a hygienist? For something that costs $5k+, this seems strange to me. How were your first/second appointments and what should I expect? They said they would need to trim some teeth to make room, but I don't understand how this will be done if the doctor is not even there.The only thing my hygienist did by herself was the scans. My dentist always checked in on my Invisalign appointments. This seems off to me.Yea I don't know how they are going to do the IPR without any dentist (and I've read some scary IPR stories)... just hoping this is not how they became a diamond providerMy attachments were installed by a dental assistant/hygienist (something) and i was okay with it, same with the filling of some pf the teeth. My views are these girls work more often with people that the orthodontist that only make judgement calls on what steps should be taken next. I guess i see it like this because in my line of work field experience is better than a title; so while I appreciate my orthodontist to check on my progress I dont expect her to do every tiny procedure on me.Bondings are commonly done by the dental assistants. Can be with or without the doctor. However if IPR is involved, it needs to be done by the ortho themselves.I agree that the assistants are very capable; however, its weird that the provider wont even be on site to check the work. I dont see a lot of my ortho, but she checks in for a few minutes during each appointment.At every single one of my visits my ortho comes over and asks me how I feel, what I want fixed and does the ipr himself. Damn right for the price paid.As a retired registered dental hygienist in Ontario, yes it is common to see dental hygienists (not dental assistants) for many of your routine visits to the orthodontist. They require a two year intensive training program and must pass a standardized Ontario board exam.  They are one of several  provincially regulated health professonals such as nurses, physiotherapists, doctors, dentists, optometrists, etc.It's kind of like how nurses do your IVs and give you meds and do all your direct care, under the direct and indirect supervision of doctors.\\n\\nHygienists are well trained assistants and do the majority of your direct care at the dentist, and orthodontic assistants at the orthodontist - under the direct and indirect supervision of dentists and orthodontists.My orthos assistant did most of the physical work on me. My ortho did the planning on the treatment and the removal of my attachments. She always checks my mouth when I visit but the scans and attachment installation was done by the assistant.My ortho and the hygienist were there when I did both of my scans, and then the hygienist put on the attachments and my first trays by herself. The ortho came in to check, gave the all clear, and came back at the end to ask if I had questions. The hygienist did a great job explaining the whole procedure and answered all of the questions that I had. I've had the same dentist and hygienist for a few years now though, so I had no issues with her doing the procedure\\n\\nEdit: spellingFor my visit to get the trays started, the ortho assistant put the attachments on and then the ortho did the IPR and made sure everything fit as outlined by the treatment plan. The assistant told me only the orthos at the office do the IPRs.A hygienist shouldnt have an issue applying attachments or doing IPR. They are even allowed to give numbing shots, they can do many things a dentist can. Every appointment Ive had has been with an assistant. An assistant did my scan and applied my attachments.

I  have ground into several night guards. Honestly my grinding has improved since me having my trays in. I think its setting my bite better and Im not clenching as hard. If you get opinions just let them know that you are a night grinder. My ortho did not seem phased by it and I have some pretty significant wear.Great to know, thank you.

I know there is a lot of post out there for using Invisalign to loose weight but Im looking to GAIN or MAINTAIN. I have found it extremely difficult to snack and not intermittently fast. \\n\\nDoes anyone have tips/recommendations/suggestions on how they maintained their weight on Invisalign?I had the same issue. Im very skinny as well, and my first couple of weeks I lost weight. I cant eat enough in one sitting/meal, Im used to eating throughout the day. Honestly I just have to take out my trays more often and eat because ultimately your nutrition is more important. I still try to eat quickly so its not too big of a deal.Amazing to know that there are people out there with the same problem. Btw, does taking it off so frequently not affect your treatment ?I\\'m also right there with ya. I\\'ve lost a few pounds I couldn\\'t afford to. \\n\\nBut I agree with everyone else as far as \"go ahead and snack\". It\\'s not a big deal. My issue comes with the couple of painful days. \\n\\nI eat less on those days because it hurts. And then (as a person who only manages basic tasks if they are a rigid routine) the days I am not in pain, I have trouble eating properly because I messed with the routine. \\n\\nLol I realize that that is more than likely not your problem as well, but I thought maybe it would make you feel better.No Ive had one tooth that had trouble tracking, but that was in the beginning when I wasnt taking out my trays as often. Now I take them out frequently and eat, and my teeth are moving perfectly!I had to buy some meal supplement with high calories to drink because I was losing weightIm going to try this  with my meals. Thanks :)i suggest you not to stress with the wear time take your time eat.. also eat snacks you wont lose progress if you wear them a bit lessEat whenever you want. \\n\\nIt is one of the things that Invisalign advertises, you can eat whatever whenever. At first, you might be really strict with brushing your teeth every single time you take them out (like I was), but rinsing and popping the trays back in is completely fine, especially for a light snack.maybe try to get some calories in with fluids? smoothies, juices, things that wont be too hard to clean out of ur mouth if ur in a rushWhat is causing you to *lose* weight? Are you not eating enough?\\n\\nI suggest using the MyFitnessPal app to make sure you\\'re getting the calories you need each day. While doing Invisalign, I don\\'t snack muchÂ\\xa0but my regular meals have to be larger than usual.I have stomach issues that prevent me from eating too much at once, but at the same time going too long without food can also trigger discomfort. I get around it by taking my trays out when I need to eat - even if its just a snack to keep me going until lunch/dinner. There will be days where you keep your trays in 22+ hours and days where you will have them in less! Clearly, we care about achieving our best possible smiles :) but its important not to neglect our bodies + overall health in the meantime!\\n\\nEdit: grammar1-2 scoops Whey protein + 1 cup Oats + 1 tbsp peanut butter + 200 ml milk \\n\\nBlend it and finish it over the course of the day. You can dilute it further if its too thick. Dont need to remove your trays to have it but make sure to rinse thoroughly after you have it (or just remove your trays for 1-2 mins, rinse your mouth and trays, and put them back in)\\n\\nThis will give you about 500 healthy calories. Along with your current intake that should help you maintain or gain weightCant you just eat the way you always have? Theres no real reason for people to be starving with Invisalign.\\n\\nAlthough popping the trays in and out is an extra step that takes a few extra seconds, I dont find it interferes with eating as normal. If I want to eat something I pop my trays out, eat it, and pop them back in. Invisalign hasnt impacted how/when/how often I eat or drink at all.Eat more during your meal times. You can still snack, just floss and brush when youre done.I have had this same problem. Im also thin and losing weight isnt ideal. I have just started snacking with the Invisalign in. Some orthos recommend that you eat with them in anyway (mine does not, to be clear). Ive had no problems, just dont eat anything super crunchy to avoid breaking the aligners, or anything that will stain them. Then I usually swish some water and clean them when I have time to. I am on weekly changes so Im not super concerned about stains anyway.I wanted to say the sameI was worried about the same problem. When I have my trays out for meals I eat a lot. I get very full. Ive actually put on a little weight which Im happy about. But yeah, eat as much as you can when the trays are out. Dont be afraid of snacking too. If youre hungry then eat! Just put the trays back in ASAP!I also lost weight while doing invisalign. Various factors make keeping my weight up a challenge, and the Invisalign just added another barrier, compounding the problem.  There are high-calorie snacks and protein/high calorie drinks. Of course not the ideal healthy food, but when you can get 350 calories + 20g of protein from a small drink, it helps.I would say just eat bigger meals when you have the trays out.Ive put on 6kg since starting Invisalign last August I just binge eat when I have them out instead of snacking all day which I use to do.You dont have to put so much pressure. Eat a snack and rinse your mouth with water really well. It even says you can do that. Invisiline shouldnt stop you from being able to eat.  :)I lift weights, and am not willing to see. Any gains go out the window, I also lost weight  and it was killing me.. \\n\\nI. Now just eat what I want when I want. And my progress seems to be going  good . Just brush afterwards, and if you cant rinse with waterIm on the same boat but Im bulking rn. MASSGAINER SHAKES BROI eat bigger meals. I aim to include protein and grains with breakfast.

I think it just doesnt work as well for some people. My second provider was of the opinion that the first one should never have started me in Invisalign. My bite is basically just my premolars. Kinda get used to it, sometimes its annoying that you just wanna clench and release that tension in the jaw, but its hard to get that full pressure at the back. Chew more sideways rather than up and down. Check thick gum of your jaw hurts from not being able to apply pressure at the back. I hate going to the dentist now.

Just keep wearing current tray.Keep wearing current trays and if someone can access your house and ship you the other trays then you save not being a few weeks behind.As others said, wear current but most importantly, try to get some cleaning tablets to soak them very often if you didnt pack them. You don't want to feel uncomfortable with smelly/yucky trays on a 3 week vacation. Safe œˆï¸\\x8fJust wear your current tray, I have to wear my current tray for 4 weeks as I need two extractions and thats the earliest I can get in, its no big deal, just make sure to be more vigilant cleaning it as youll have it in much longer than the restKeep your current trays in for the 3 weeks! I took mine out for 2 weeks after I had gum surgery. Afterwards I tried putting my 'next' set of trays in and they didn't fit. My dentist did a new scan and got me to put in my previous trays in the meantime - and I was in crazy pain for a week, more than any other time during my Invisalign journey (12 months in at this point).\\n\\n It's amazing how quickly your teeth shift. You might not progress in those 3 weeks, but it's definitely not worth falling backwards! Good luck and enjoy your vacation!Do you have trays in your mouth but just not the next ones? Or literally you have nothing?Oh youre gonna be in terrible pain but you put those shits back on ¹ wont cost you anything but your teeth will def shift back a little bit\", 'labels': ['physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'financial concerns', 'tray time management', 'self-consciousness', 'oral hygiene', 'facial appearance', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns'], 'scores': [0.31903815269470215, 0.19361364841461182, 0.14625436067581177, 0.12327121198177338, 0.10254967212677002, 0.07629717141389847, 0.03897580876946449]}, {'sequence': 'new in Invisalign and I have some troubles! need advices and tips! more in the commentTotally normal to feel pain and to feel like your teeth are weak without the trays on. Personally, I had a claustrophobic feeling for the first 3-4 days too where I wanted the trays off but the attachments were still on so I felt like I couldnt get away from it. Then one day, I guess day 4 or 5, I got used to it. Popping the trays out were difficult and messy! I am on tray 16 of 25 and feel like its a non-event to even switch to the next tray. Some soreness but nothing more than that. You can do this!  Take Motrin and try to make your tray changes at night right before you fall asleep. You will acclimate while sleeping.Thank you very much for sharing! do you use chewies? And do you feel pain in using it?Yes, I do use the chewies... That\\'s the number one phrase my orthodontist says (he\\'s a man of few words). If there are any gaps in my trays between the tooth and the tray end, he will recommend I do the chewies a ton to get the teeth to settle in. There is some discomfort with doing this, but I had a scare a few weeks back where 2 teeth weren\\'t tracking and the idea of scrapping my case and starting over was discussed. I did the chewies at my desk at work, morning, night, while driving... People must have thought I was a smoker! I\\'m happy to report I was able to move to the next tray and keep my plan going as-is... I\\'m sure there will be revisions at the end, but so far, I\\'m quite happy, and I now associate the pain of doing the chewies with progress, so it doesn\\'t bother me that much anymore.Thank you!! Ok I will be strong ans I will use the chewies cause I have a 1/1.5mm gap between tray and teeth!!Remember, this is progress. When you first insert your tray, your teeth will necessarily be way out of whack! The process of wearing for a week / 2 weeks, whatever your duration is to get the teeth to slide into the slots created for them. On a microscopic level, the bone and ligaments are breaking and rebuilding, hence the pain. Its\\' really fascinating that this all happens, and quickly too. I\\'m impressed that my teeth (I\\'m in my 40s) are still so pliable. Also, this is the reason why after the process, you need to wear your retainers for so long. You\\'re giving your bone, sockets, ligaments time to rebuild a nice, solid footing. \\n\\nHappy Straightening!Just wanted to say this is such a great description of what is happening and how it works - thank you. I also just went and grabbed a chewie after reading it \\x81Happy Cake Day!!Thanks! Didnt even notice!Yw! ^^Thank you for your kind words! I really needed some support and motivation!!I remember being where you are. It does improve! Someone here was super kind and listened to me, and youll do the same from the next one, and so on. have a great dayYes its totally normal to have pain when removing the tray. as the teeth are senstive from being moved. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe pain should go over pretty quickly after taking the trays out, and when they go back in there will be a period again where theres pain/tightness around the teeth.Yes the pain disappears quickly but I can\\'t bite anything but really soft food (like boiled potatoes!)is it normal?I am on Tray 2 of 19.  I definitely experienced discomfort with chewing (not pain).  It still doesn\\'t feel \"comfortable\" to chew, but I have noticed an improvement. \\n\\nYour teeth are going through trauma. This is very normal.Yes, very normal. I think on my 3rd set of aligners though I really started to notice the difference as my teeth were getting used to moving.\\n\\nThe pain that remains is very temporary, and much less painful.\\n\\nI\\'m late on in my treatment, and can eat crusty bread, crisps, steak, anything; even a couple days after changing aligners. \\n\\nIt gets better, good luck![Click this for tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/qkzvab/tips_from_someone_1_year_into_invisalign/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf/)Thank you for posting this! I am 4 days into 42 trays and have so many questions lol.Hi guys I really need help this is the 3rd days of Invisalign and I am in trouble!\\nIs normal to feel pain when you remove the trays? (My trays are really stuck on my teeth and I am worried to take off a tooth when I remove the tray!!)\\nI have a gap between my teeth an the trays as you can see in the photo. I use chewies but It is very painful and it doesn\\'t work. It will adjust in few days or have to fit perfectly from the beginning?\\nI am not able to eat normally because chew is too painful and I am eating only \"soft\" food is it normal? How long I have to endure the pain?\\nIt will be like this at each tray change??\\nI have to change the trays every 2 weeks\\n\\nPleeeeease give me some advice and strength because I am totally regretting my choice!!\\nThank you!That all sounds normal. Don\\'t worry, you won\\'t damage your teeth and you won\\'t damage the invisalign taking them on and off, and it is normal to have some tenderness, especially when eating. The discomfort may be the same, less, or more with future trays. Usually it is less than with the first aligners. Try switching into your new one at night before going to bed, this allows you to miss the most uncomfortable part of a new aligner. Keep it up!Are you removing them correctly? I didn\\'t read the instructions and was removing mine wrong for the first two days. I\\'m on my fourth set of trays and I remember my teeth feeling super weak and weird for the first week or so. It\\'s normal though and stops hurting after a bit.I think I do it correctly but actually the explanation of my ortho was reeeeally quick. I start to remove the tray from the inside  bottom and then I proceed to the frontBuy something called a pul tool which will help you remove the trays.Honestly, it becomes a natural routine you wont even think about them. Just use chewies putting them in to maximise movement. And take them out when eating and be free with it, eventually it just becomes natural that theyre in! \\n\\nFor cleaning I would clean them with the cleaning crystals once a week and your toothbrush everyday. I also use water to clean my teeth after a meal when at work etcMy dentist recommended 2-3 days.  Has a week worked for you?It has if you use water and your brush at night mine stay clear all weekFirst tray is the worst. Once you get past that first one it pretty much becomes routine and isnt bad at all. I had to shave the first 3 trays down a little bit with an emery board because they would have burrs on them that would hurt my gums. I don\\'t have to do that anymore, I guess my gums have gotten more tough? I\\'m on tray 9. You can do it! Totally normally to feel like you\\'re going to pull a tooth out at first, but like I said, after that first tray it becomes routine and it almost feels weird not to have your trays in.I\\'m not quite 24 hours in to my very first tray, and I\\'m already thinking I\\'m going to really lose weight lol. I HATE removing my top tray since I have so many attachments up top, and even bought Bubly sparkling water with caffeine to avoid removal for coffee.

Ill cross seas for that price ‚I had a couple teeth mildly misaligned so my ortho said there was very little point going through Invisalign as its a flat rate at his clinic. Instead he did the scan and impressions which the NHS paid for, sent them off to SMT and then helped me fit my aligners. I had 14 trays Im now on tray 13. Everything was super smooth so far and hes an ambassador for them so he got money from the company as well lolCould you explain what your issues are. How much was the treatment in totalMy treatment was Â674+Â50 so Â724 in total. I paid upfront obviously. I had a couple of teeth mildly misaligned, went for an invis consult with an ortho a couple miles away. Got the Invisalign. Snapped some trays. Got it refunded because the ortho snapped a brand new tray trying to get it on my teeth (there was a manufacturing defect) so I got my money back in like 3 working days. Then I went to my previous ortho who did my childhood braces and he said well theres no point in doing invis as its a flat rate unless you have a severe case. So he did my scan and impressions which was paid for by the NHS, sent them off to SMT, reviewed and accepted the plan they made and then fitted my first set of aligners. Ive seen him a couple times throughout my treatment but I only had 14 trays. Im now on tray 13 and everything is perfect, just need to finish pulling my front right tooth forward a little more, which Ive looked at tray 14 vs my current tray 13 and the adjustment I need is there.Thanks for sharing! That sounds pretty straight forward aside from the broken trays. How comes the scans were paid for by the NHS? Also, can I have the name of the place you went to please?xSure its called Spire. Yeah its been great apart from the Invisalign part! And we have universal healthcare so scans and stuff are usually paid for. Or mine was anyway. They always have been. Idk whats its like where youre from but Ive always had everything except like crowns and teeth removal paid for (Ive never needed a crown or a tooth removed so idk how much it is) but in general yep its really good and I wouldnt change to Invisalign at all.Ive also heard some orthos offer 3M aligners so if youre not bothered about the brand name of Invisalign then it may be worth looking into?He is a consultant for Invisalign and an ambassador for SMT, so either way he got money from it so he recommended the best and most cost effective treatment for me. I had trays 1 to 5 then went and picked up trays 6 to 11 then went and got trays 12 to 14 and one set of retainers. Im going for a rescan in a couple weeks to double check how my retainers are fitting, but Ive tracked very well throughout and my wear time is like 23 hours per day so no issues. Very straight teeth.

Invisalign works as so: we submit xrays and a treatment plan to your insurance for a pre authorization amount. This is usually done following an ortho records appointment. Most insurance companies will pay approx 50 percent up to a lifetime maximum of $2500 for orthodontics. If the treatment case is $8000 and insurance will cover $2500 the patient is on the hook for the remaining $5500 spread out over the treatment duration. So for an 18 month case it would be about $300/month for the 18 months. We don't charge tax or interest on treatment. Just charge your credit card automatically for payments. A little more info than you asked for but hope you found it helpful.My total treatment cost is $4850 from orthodontist for 19 trays/38 weeks plus retainer. Im paying $200/month for 13 months. $1500 was covered by insurance and $1200 from HSA. My teeth are straight, no bite issues, have comprehensive plan to eliminate gaps/spacing.

Here are the answers to your questions!**I AM NOT A DENTIST OR ORTHODONTIST. I AM AN INTERNET SHITPOSTER, AS ARE THE PEOPLE COMMENTING BELOW**. NEVER take the opinion of an internet stranger over that of a healthcare professional. \\n\\nWith that said...\\n\\n* Welcome! Yes, the first 1-7 days will suck. Your Dentist / Ortho will soft peddle this, but your teeth have been in the same place for a long time, and quite like it. Applying sustained pressure over time makes all of them move and there is no break. That takes a while to get used to. Your teeth will feel bruised. Some will feel like they\\'re sliding in the wrong direction. Everything will feel wrong. But good news! It doesn\\'t last long. 1-3 days is the norm, some people a few more. Of course, it might not at all. You might be a super hero, or have no nerves in your mouth.\\n\\n* Everything feels massive even when it isn\\'t. It\\'s your mouth! and it\\'s changing! Tiny movements feel huge. \\n\\n* Trayminder or the Invisalign app are great and help you track progress, time your trays in and out, and generally get used to the whole thing. Most people use them heavily early on, then just use them to take progress pics.\\n\\n* Even with amazing cleaning skills, your trays will discolour over time. Don\\'t obsess about it, it\\'s not worth it. Your teeth aren\\'t crystal white, your trays don\\'t need to be perfectly clear. \\n\\n* Some attachments fall off. Depending on your dentist, most don\\'t care if one or two ping off. They\\'ll replace them on the next appointment if they need to. Don\\'t panic!\\n\\n* Amazon sell aligner cleaning tabs that you drop in warm water and will strip much of the days crap off your aligners and leave them with a pleasant warm minty glow. You just dropped four figures on those things, don\\'t cheap out. Spend the $15. - [UK link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07QCPGR14/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_6AA9886R1CTX9PXRFVHC) and [USA Link](https://www.amazon.com/Retainer-Brite-Tablets-Months-Supply/dp/B005GRGARE/) . (These are two of the more popular products - plenty of others are available and I\\'m not endorsing any of them in particular, just the process itself)\\n\\n* Blood is normal, except when it isn\\'t. There\\'s a small pocket each tooth sits in, within your gum. When teeth move, it can be agitated. Some people bleed, some people don\\'t. It\\'s not unusual for a bit of blood in new trays for the first couple of days. A lot of blood *is* unusual. If you\\'re concerned, talk to your practitioner. after/during periods of heavy movement you may feel like your teeth are even a tiny bit loose. This, too, can be normal! Theyre moving in your mouth and arent 100% settled. But if they feel VERY loose, talk to an expert ASAP. \\n\\n* Depending on the creation process, your trays may have some sharper/more pronounced edges that make your mouth sore. Its totally okay to get a nail file and use that Emory board to gently smooth out the part that is making your mouth hurt. If that doesnt work, a bit of orthodontic wax can help create a barrier between pointy Invisalign parts and your tender, delicate mouth. (thanks /u/Okay-Look)\\n\\n* This sub uses \"ortho\" a lot, which I always thought was \"orthopaedic surgeon\" but seems to be American for \"Orthodontist\". The more you know...\\n\\n* Flossing is your friend. You will soon know if you have anything wedged between your teeth after an hour or so of wearing your trays. And it isn\\'t fun. \\n\\n* Cotton Mouth - or dry mouth, is really common. This can last several weeks (mine did) and is really annoying. Again, water is your friend. Your mouth doesn\\'t like foreign objects in it sometimes, and needs time to adjust. \\n\\n* That said, do you need to obsessively brush after every meal? or wait half an hour after acidic foods, or anything else? It\\'s entirely up to what you\\'re comfortable with / able to do. Many people get by swishing water after a lunch. Some people drink clear drinks with their aligners. Some monsters drink black coffee. Just remember you\\'re wearing tight shields that hold stuff to your teeth - acid, sugar, etc. Water is your friend. Or a portable mouthwash and floss kit, which lots of people also swear by. (H/T /u/Tortugay)\\n\\n* \"I didn\\'t manage the full 22 hours!\" that\\'s OK. Generally anything over 20 is a win. But if you aim for 20, you might only hit 18, and that *is* dangerzone. Aim for 22. If you fall a bit short, it is what it is. \\n\\n* Yes, that 2mm of plastic on top of the teeth is normal. That\\'s about the depth of each aligner. If it\\'s more than that, or you notice a tooth moving away, talk to your ortho / dentist as soon as possible and move back a tray. If it\\'s just really tight, use your chewie to align it!\\n\\n* There\\'s no right or wrong way to remove aligners. There\\'s loads of Youtube videos on how some people do it. Others buy key tools from Amazon to unhook them. It\\'s whatever works. And yes, the first few times it really sucks. Sorry - you paid thousands for tooth pain, you sucker. Think of the photos the other end!\\n\\n* There is no \"normal\" amount of trays. Hang around on this sub long enough and you\\'ll see people who have taken 70+ to adjust what look like mild misalignment, and people with mouths like Victorian graveyards saying they only needed 18. At the end of the day, only your dentist and Mr Invisalign in his magic factory know what\\'s the right number for you. \\n\\n* 14 day changeovers? 10 days? 7 days? Ask your dentist. Many people start with long changeovers to get teeth used to moving, then speed up. It\\'s unwise to retime your plan without supervision, so don\\'t. \\n\\n* Most people put their new aligners in at night. This is smart. You fall asleep before it gets too pinchy and when you wake up, your teeth are already well underway. \\n\\n* If any of your bags have \"IPR\" on them... congratulations! You\\'ve won an \"InterProximal Reduction\" - shaving your teeth down to make room for the movement. It\\'s... weird. But it doesn\\'t hurt. And again, it\\'s removing only a tiny, safe amount of enamel. \\n\\n* Some people get their teeth movement animation (called a \"clincheck\") from their Dentist. Most are kept locked away, for reasons no-one can explain. \\n\\nI\\'m sure there\\'s more stuff - what am I forgetting? Happy to add to this and credit.As someone who once had a mouth like a \\'Victorian Graveyard\\' that bit sure made me chuckle, as did black coffee monsters (I\\'m not one of those :P) Great points!\\n\\nI\\'d also like to add that it\\'s good to carry around a to-go bag with toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash (for those times you don\\'t want to make awkward eye contact with someone in a public bathroom as toothpaste froths in your mouth, it\\'s easier to spit mouthwash into a toilet away from public view) and floss/floss picks - and take pictures, and then obsessively look at those pictures when it\\'s particularly painful whispering \"it\\'s worth it, it\\'s worth it\".The comment about the tray #\\'s is hilariously accurate. I went in for two small gaps and will end up probably in that 70 tray range. I come on here and look and see teeth piled on top of each other and the posters are done in 3 months. :-)I am beginning to suspect the other side of Invisalign Lite is Invisalign-Max, and it involves a hammer.Every time you eat your teeth will be tender.Thats how you know its *good* though.Crunchy things are the worst.  Even potato chips are a bit difficult.Or if you\\'re like me... The pain will literally never lessen and your speech will be incredibly fucked and you won\\'t really be able to chew\\n\\nI\\'m not a newbie - 5 months in.Same ŽIt\\'s crazy how different people are, i got mine on Thursday and the pain has reduced significantly and only have a lisp on some words. I hope it gets better for you!I\\'ve been told that most people put their new aligners in at night so that they can sleep through the transition but I prefer to put them on in the morning so by time I go to bed I am not kept awake by discomfort.Thanks this is very helpful! Im only three weeks in and am still experiencing very tough days adjusting to this plastic in my mouth ha. Can you link the Amazon cleaning tablets? Thanks!Done and done!Thanks! Ordered!I\\'m on tray 20 of 20. The only thing I would not agree with in this post is buying those overpriced Amazon cleaner tabs! Get the ones for $4 at Target from Polident. They work just as well and we\\'ll save you a bunch of money. I soak mine in the tabs in the morning and in the evening. Doing lunch time I just set my trays in water.I\\'ve seen mixed reports on denture cleaners being as good as specific retainer cleaners, although I suspect it\\'s all the same stuff. I\\'m not in the US so only posted an obvious Amazon link. I\\'m sure TargÃ or Wallmart do cheaper and as good. Like I said, no endorsement of any one route. The UK amazon ones are the ones I got, and they\\'re... fine.My local Wally-world has polident & crest œaligner/retainer\\x9d tabs and also a pump-foam.  I like the flavor  the polident cleaner tabs leave and this is lowest effort.  I also like the pump foam when I want to actually brush my aligners.  I change between these methods, and also soak aligners in hydrogen peroxide a couple times a week for 5-10 mins per my orthos recommendations.\\n\\nI didnt do any advance research on Invisalign (thought they were for cosmetic issues and I was comfortable with the small gap I had, turns out I needed them for TMJ).  Holy hell that pain the first 2 weeks was unreal, both from the trays and the attachments scraping my cheek when eating.  Ora-jel gave some relief to my scraped up cheeks. The tray removing tools were a godsend!  I wish I had seen this post last summer!  4 more trays to go!Great advice! I\\'d add that attachments will probably fall off. I\\'m only on my second tray and I\\'ve already lost one. Not the end of the world. Also you may not have pain and that\\'s ok too. I have yet to experience what I\\'d call real pain. I\\'ve had some tenderness...bruised feeling as you said, but mostly intense pressure. People tend to freak out about the disruption to their eating schedule/habits and that\\'s totally understandable. I barely ate anything my first day because I struggled so much to get the trays off. Yes I still definitely snack less than I used to because I just can\\'t be bothered, but I\\'m still learning and everyone will find what works best for them. Use chewies/munchies. I had gotten some beforehand and my dentist ended up giving me some too but I didn\\'t bother much with them the first week or so because the trays felt and looked like they fit really well. But I started using them more often and for longer periods of time and they really do alleviate a lot of the pressure and overall make it feel like the trays are fitting even better. You will start to feel changes before you see them. I see no difference in my teeth at this point but by day 5 I could feel my molars no longer touching. Just this morning when I had my trays out, I noticed that my bottom front teeth now touch the backs of my top front teeth. It\\'s an interesting process. Thanks for posting!I had attachments on almost every tooth for almost 4 months, and not a single one ever fell off or even came close to falling off. They felt super secure and I was never worried they\\'d fall off. Maybe it depends on how good a job the dentist did xDYou\\'re lucky! I made it almost to the end of my first tray and figured I was in the clear but then I took the trays off for dinner one night and it was still in my tray. Depends on a lot I think. Skill of the dentist, which tooth and which spot on the tooth, if you eat something hard, if you take off your trays too forcefully. And sometimes none of that matters and you\\'ll lose a lot of them or none at all. At least they\\'re easy to replace.[deleted]GIVE ME MY SECRETS, TOOTHMAN!I had to pay extra for mine but it was part of the package reading this I didnt realise some people saw them and others didnt.Oh, I get *shown* it every time I go in. Am I allowed a copy? no.My dentist let me take a video of it on my phone!This is a great start. A couple items to add:\\n- Just like the œa tiny bit of blood can be normal, but a lot of blood isnt\\x9d - after/during periods of heavy movement you may feel like your teeth are even a tiny bit loose. This, too, can be normal! Theyre moving in your mouth and arent 100% settled. But if they feel VERY loose, talk to an expert ASAP. \\n- Depending on the creation process, your trays may have some sharper/more pronounced edges that make your mouth sore. Its totally okay to get a nail file and use that Emory board to gently smooth out the part that is making your mouth hurt. If that doesnt work, a bit of orthodontic wax can help create a barrier between pointy Invisalign parts and your tender, delicate mouth.Done!Thank you! I did indeed get my first aligners just three hours ago. No real pain so far, but it\\'s super weird. I have had one meal and I did NOT enjoy the attachments on my teeth, I got a bit scraped up inside my cheeks. Any tips for that?Errtime.\\n\\nYou might get some sores from where they run initially, but much like Tahiti, your mouth is a magical place and will soon adjust.Got it. Thanks Agent Coulson! :)My mouth got torn up by one of my attachments in particular. I got Orthodots from Amazon. They are made of silicone and stay on better than the wax. I put it on the attachment before eating for the first few days because it was SO painful and raw. I would take it off before putting the trays back on. Amazingly, it stayed in place while I ate. I was careful about it. But after I few days, my mouth got used to it and I gradually stopped needing the orthodots. Also, rinse with warm salt water. It will reduce mouth tissue soreness a lot.Thank you! Yeah, it\\'s mainly in one spot that I\\'m having a hard time. None of them feel great but one is just awful. I appreciate the tips!Good luck! It will get better soon!They do wear down and become more comfortable. You can either suck it up until they wear down a bit or you can get some ortho wax and put it over them to help your mouthI did get wax, but can you put it over the attachment and the aligner will still fit?Im confused why you would need both wax and your aligners at the same timeI\\'ve never used wax before in my life, are you supposed to put it over while you\\'re eating and then take it back off?Its not specifically for attachments you remove the wax before you eat. You dont eat with it in. You use it while waiting 30 mins to brush your teeth if you do that. Or if your aligner has a sharp bit you can pop some over. But while you wear aligners it really shouldnt be an issue its only when you take them off. Its not a problem if you swallow a small amount but you have to pick it off afterwards as its dirty and thats annoyingRight, I don\\'t have an issue with the aligners, it\\'s the attachments that are causing a problem when I\\'m eating. Sorry if I was not clear enough about that in my initial question.You can put clean wax over them and then eat then remove all the bits before you put your aligners back on. But you dont put it on with your aligners then eat then keep the same wax onSee this [link](https://orthodonticbracescare.com/use-dental-wax-on-invisalign/)Try sticking some dental wax on them, you might end up eating some (I did) but when it stays on, it helps while eating.Orajel helps!I had zero pain! Only the first two times I put them back in. I got used to them third day, and no problems to take them away at all.Removing my trays in the beginning was utter torture. As was putting the bands on bc they never stayed. Now it\\'s all rote :)Also important to add that for pain relief, you should [NOT use NSAIDs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3467920/) (Ibuprofen, Naproxen) because they hinder the tooth movement process, and should instead use Tylenol (Acetaminophen).See, this is why I made this thread, because I didnt know that. Although Ill say Im currently taking naproxen for other reasons and it hasnt stopped anything.yeah acetaminophen does absolutely nothing for me & i have to take ibuprofen for pains. thankfully it doesnt seem to have inhibited anything for me, and i was taking it around the clock when i had covid recentlyI still take ibuprofen sometimes too. I don\\'t imagine it\\'s a huge deal either way, but I try to limit my usage just in case.I\\'ve actually not seen that advice anywhere, so I\\'m going to leave it out for the time being. Good to know some have been told that, though.I take daily celebrex and my ortho said it wouldnt be an issue.at most a 1% reduction in treatment.This is a Fakespot Reviews Analysis bot.

And it\\'s not over as fast as I would\\'ve thought (especially the first time)There\\'s two people at my practice, and I\\'ve had IPR with both. The one actually uses a fine dentist drill. It is SO MUCH faster, and less weird. The other loves the sandpaper. She\\'s a glamorous but severe eastern European woman and her opening line to me was \"you wanted orthodontics... you thought this wouldn\\'t hurt?\" So I suspect she\\'s just a sadist and loves doing it.>I suspect she\\'s just a sadist\\n\\nVery well might be ’ mine uses sandpaper too and there\\'d be so much blood. The first time, my gums bled again after being cleaned up, so I walked around with bloody aligners without even knowing.\\n\\nI directed a mother and daughter to his office on my way out and I\\'m sure they had to have been terrified seeing my mouth full of bloodYeah, if you have a hamfisted ortho who cant avoid your gums, its gonna suckI would add getting ultra fine sandpaper that is used for cars instead of an Emory board.  Less scratchy on the aligner.   Wet I the paper but you can reuse.The bumps some trays have on the back of the top front teeth are usually bite ramps, not for attachments.Whats a bite ramp?When you close your mouth, your bottom front teeth would rest on the bite ramps, preventing you from closing your jaw completely.  This leaves a gap  between your top and bottom molars, taking pressure off of them and making it easier for them to move.Maybe you should add that not everyone is in pain from their aligners. I\\'m one of a lot who got worried about having zero pain or soreness from the beginning. It\\'s a different experience for everyone, there is no \"normal\".\\n\\nAlso, add the advice to keep your aligners wet so they won\\'t dry up with saliva on it and get smelly. To store them in a glass of water while having them out.\\n\\nGreat list so far!...that\\'s literally in the first point....Apparently I missed that, then. Still didn\\'t read anything about the water. Just trying to help. ·\\x8f¼\\x8dï¸\\x8fGreat list! Hopefully it\\'ll get stickiedew users will read it. Another point to add: keeping your trays wet while out of your mouth will keep them tasting and smelling good. When I\\'m eating, etc., I wash mine off with soap, then soak them in water or water with soap or cleaning tab solution, then brush them before putting back in my mouth and they are good for my 14 day changes (not looking/feeling/smelling gross).Adding another tip I picked up here, when soaking Ill add hydrogen peroxide to the water to keep things freshI keep reading this. How much HP do you add?Maybe a third or less? HP from the drugstore is pretty harmless, the bottle I have is a 3% dilution and I rinse the trays off before putting back in my mouth. I dont want to be too wasteful since I find myself taking out my trays 3-4x a day. Im considering getting one of those ultrasonic cleaners eventually.Thanks! I saw someone post their orthodontist\\'s instructions and it sounded like they added HP to a solution and reused it all week. I\\'m not sure I\\'m into that, but that\\'s because I haven\\'t learned about HP. Possibly cleans the solution, ongoing? I have an ultrasonic and it seems good, but my trays haven\\'t ever been that yucky before going in, so I can\\'t tell if it\\'s really doing anything. My 14 day tray changes still look/smell ok, so maybe it\\'s doing great things?Oh I toss the water and hp after every soak.  I can see bits of saliva float up in the water once they sink so thats pretty satisfying. I also run them under cold water and brush them with a soft bristle toothbrush every time. Im on weekly changes so not a huge deal right now Im just thinking ahead when Ill be waiting on refinements or end game, my nightly retainer!This is great, thanks!\\n\\nMaybe its worth adding what happens at the end, I had no clue how long I had to wait for. Probably all experiences are different but my case was as follows\\n\\n- at the appointment after wearing the last tray for a week I was told I didnt need refinements and was scanned for whitening trays\\n- after a week I came back (I had to keep using the last tray) and got my attachments removed and was given whitening treatment to apply for 4 weeks. I was told to keep using my last tray as well (that is quite stained by now) but that I dont have to stick to 22 hs a day anymore\\n- at my next appointment I get composite bonding and my retainers\\n- the endI\\'m still mid-treatment, so this is even useful for me, thanks.Thanks for this! Honestly this sub has been awesome through and through, everyone here was incredibly helpful with their advice, sharing experiences and progress, so thank you all for your amazing efforts.\\n\\n\\nEdit: just wanted to say to my fellow black coffee lovers, invest in a good reusable straw! I learned the hard way that excess coffee consumption _may_ stain your attachments and youd have to change them.uh ohI just started Invisalign literally 3 days ago. How do you all deal with taking them out when youve got attachments? Im getting to the point where I dont even want to eat things because its so much of a pain in the a** to take them out. It genuinely takes me 2 minutes alone to just take the top tray out.It gets easier... trust. I panicked the first day, thought I\\'d pinged an attachment off, etc. It all feels so *wrong*.\\n\\nYou\\'ll get to a point where you\\'ll start idly popping them on and off (or at least I have with my lower tray) before you know it. It\\'s just a learning curve. But we\\'ve all done it, so it can\\'t be that hard!Orthokey or similar from Amazon saved me. I actually prefer the Pul tool.\\n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YCVBRQ1/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_ME3X4NFQFSX79PR32HDT?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1Everyone! Thank you for being so helpfulWhat an excellent post , thank youA hot water bottle has been suggested for the pain. I have my aligners fitted next week so Im yet to try it :)A fitted hot water bottle? Fancy. I just took paracetamol.Sorry! Edited for clarity. I have stocked up on painkillers as well but just in case I need something extra.Thank you for this! My kids are both on week 4 and this helps me feel prepared (attachments next week!).Thank you so much for this. Im ending week 6 (tray 3) and my teeth are suddenly feeling sensitive (like hurting when the air hits them kind of sensitive). Should I be worried I am wearing away my enamel somehow? I make a point of only waterpiking and rinsing super well after meals and brush well twice a day. I clean the trays religiously (denture tabs once a day - are these ok to use?). My only crime is that I do drink maybe three diet cokes a day carefully through a straw and try to rinse well with water afterwords but sometimes forget. Thank you!We aren\\'t dentists. Always ask a professional. But - it\\'s likely your teeth are sensitive from moving. You may be confusing enamel sensitivity with wider tooth sensitivity. You might not though, who knows. Check with your provider.Many thanks. Im seeing my Ortho this coming week, and will ask.Thank you for this!! I just started today.. •••Great job! Thank you!thank you! my advice for anyone that has to wear elastics wear them!!! my orthodontist said that theyre speeding up the process a lot. \\n\\nalso if one of your buttons falls off, dont panic, just call your dentist/orthodontist and theyll most likely try to get you in ASAP. i once had one come off at work and they were able to fix it during my lunch break!Question from someone who is thinking about Invisalign. How many trays do they issue you at once. For a lot of the year I work out of town for as long as 6 weeks at a time. Do they issue you enough for a few changes or do you have to go in for each tray? Thanks.I am only on my first œbatch\\x9d, but I got 7 sets.Awesome thank you.I get 3 trays at a time, amounting to 6 weeks!Perfect, thank you and happy cake day.Totally varies. Some practices give you a handful at a time so you have to come back for your next appt. Mine gave me all of my trays at once and only wanted to see me every couple of months. It massively varies.This may have been due to the timing/COVID but I got all 60 of my initial trays at once. 4 boxes! Im on refinements now (24), and they gave me 12 at a time for these. Im sure they can work with you to give you as many as possible! Ive done most of my check-ins virtually/sending photos so we didnt need a ton of in-person appointments.Dry mouth! I didnt see this anywhere when I first had my Invisalign! \\nBut it can happen and its super uncomfortable.\\nMy first week of my first tray, holy moly was my mouth dry! I would wake up in the middle of the night just to swish my mouth with water..\\n\\nBut eventually after a week it was gone and saliva production was back to normal ŠHOW DID I FORGET THIS? My first three weeks my mouth was like a pharoah\\'s sock. I\\'ll add it.To this day the weirdest thing for me was the first few days when my teeth were indescribably itchy. \\n\\nNot my gums. My teeth (the nerves that supplied them, anyway)\\n\\nIt was bizarre! But thankfully went away pretty soon thereafterUse chewies or if you don\\'t have chewies my dentist said I could use a folded towel or folded tissues something to bite on to help set your aligners.\"Mouths like Victorian graveyards\"! lol\\n\\nI say that I had teeth like stonehenge!\\n\\nMy first 2 weeks sucked tbh, but things gradually got better and now Invisalign is the new normal for me. The first half hour of having trays in it felt so strange and I drooled and slurred a lot, this calmed down after about half an hour. I had sore patches, orthodontic wax was a waste of time and money as it never stayed in place and got stuck inside my trays, I sand mine down with a fine sandpaper and find this a better way of dealing with sharp edges. I had 2 days of really dry lips in the first week, this passed. I did find it hard to talk and lisped for a while, this stopped being noticeable within 2 weeks.\\n\\nAt the time I hated the experience of getting used to invisalign but believe me it is so worth sticking with, I\\'m on tray 19 of 71 now and am so happy with my progress, a couple of weeks of discomfort and awkwardness is worth it for having fixed teeth for the rest of my life, and for solving something I\\'d hated about myself for years.\\n\\nCleaning tablets, I just use denture cleaning tablets available from any chemist/drug store for under Â2. I\\'ve had no problems with them and see no point in spending more.\\n\\nFor work meals I use Huel, a powdered nutritionally complete food that\\'s made into a shake a bit like protein shakes are, other brands are available. As it\\'s a shake it\\'s easy to rinse with a drink of water afterwards and then use mouthwash rather than spending time on my short lunch break brushing and flossing in the dirty work bathroom. I still brush and floss properly after meals at home in the morning and evening and have had no issues. I also got in the habit of having food and coffee in the same sitting so I\\'m not taking my trays out and in several times a day.\\n\\nAgain, I\\'m not a professional orthodontist, just a person with invisaligns just like all of you, these are just my personal experiences and you may choose to do things differently.\\n\\nGood luck everyone, you can do this and it gets better and easier as time goes on.so helpful, thank you![deleted]Itll come and go, youve done the hard part!', 'labels': ['self-consciousness', 'financial concerns', 'mealtime, weight and eating disorder concerns', 'tray time management', 'oral hygiene', 'physical pain and oral dysfunction', 'facial appearance'], 'scores': [0.20501771569252014, 0.16830533742904663, 0.13976562023162842, 0.13014763593673706, 0.12556637823581696, 0.12287768721580505, 0.10831966996192932]}, {'sequence': \"Getting invisalign in two weeks and just chipped a toothI was eating a mint and I chipped a piece off the back of one of my molars, I already got scanned.
